/**
* The `Matter.Runner` module is an optional utility which provides a game loop,
* that handles continuously updating a `Matter.Engine` for you within a browser.
* It is intended for development and debugging purposes, but may also be suitable for simple games.
* If you are using your own game loop instead, then you do not need the `Matter.Runner` module.
* Instead just call `Engine.update(engine, delta)` in your own loop.
*
* See the included usage [examples](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples).
