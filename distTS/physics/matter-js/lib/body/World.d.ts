/**
* The `Matter.World` module contains methods for creating and manipulating the world composite.
* A `Matter.World` is a `Matter.Composite` body, which is a collection of `Matter.Body`, `Matter.Constraint` and other `Matter.Composite`.
* A `Matter.World` has a few additional properties including `gravity` and `bounds`.
* It is important to use the functions in the `Matter.Composite` module to modify the world composite, rather than directly modifying its properties.
* There are also a few methods here that alias those in `Matter.Composite` for easier readability.
*
* See the included usage [examples](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples).
*
* @class World
* @extends Composite
