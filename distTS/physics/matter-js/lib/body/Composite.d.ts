/**
* The `Matter.Composite` module contains methods for creating and manipulating composite bodies.
* A composite body is a collection of `Matter.Body`, `Matter.Constraint` and other `Matter.Composite`, therefore composites form a tree structure.
* It is important to use the functions in this module to modify composites, rather than directly modifying their properties.
* Note that the `Matter.World` object is also a type of `Matter.Composite` and as such all composite methods here can also operate on a `Matter.World`.
*
* See the included usage [examples](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples).
