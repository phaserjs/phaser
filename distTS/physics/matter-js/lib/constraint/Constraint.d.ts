/**
* The `Matter.Constraint` module contains methods for creating and manipulating constraints.
* Constraints are used for specifying that a fixed distance must be maintained between two bodies (or a body and a fixed world-space position).
* The stiffness of constraints can be modified to create springs or elastic.
*
* See the included usage [examples](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples).
