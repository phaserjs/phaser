/**
* The `Matter.Vertices` module contains methods for creating and manipulating sets of vertices.
* A set of vertices is an array of `Matter.Vector` with additional indexing properties inserted by `Vertices.create`.
* A `Matter.Body` maintains a set of vertices to represent the shape of the object (its convex hull).
*
* See the included usage [examples](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples).
