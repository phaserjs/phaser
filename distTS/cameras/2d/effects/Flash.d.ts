 * @classdesc
 * A Camera Flash effect.
 *
 * This effect will flash the camera viewport to the given color, over the duration specified.
 *
 * Only the camera viewport is flashed. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their colors do
 * not change.
 *
 * The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an `onUpdate` callback,
 * which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect, if required.
 *
 * @class Flash
 * @memberOf Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Effects

 *
 * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The camera this effect is acting upon.
