/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Camera Shake effect.
 *
 * This effect will shake the camera viewport by a random amount, bounded by the specified intensity, each frame.
 *
 * Only the camera viewport is moved. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their positions do
 * not change.
 *
 * The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an `onUpdate` callback,
 * which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect if required.
 *
 * @class Shake
 * @memberOf Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Effects
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.5.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The camera this effect is acting upon.
