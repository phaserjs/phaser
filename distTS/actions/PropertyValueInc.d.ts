/**
 * Takes an array of Game Objects, or any objects that have a public property as defined in `key`,

 *
 * The optional `step` property is applied incrementally, multiplied by each item in the array.

 * To use this with a Group: `PropertyValueInc(group.getChildren(), key, value, step)`
 *
 * @function Phaser.Actions.PropertyValueInc
 * @since 3.3.0
 *
 * @generic {Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject[]} G - [items,$return]
 *
 * @param {(array|Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject[])} items - The array of items to be updated by this action.
 * @param {string} key - The property to be updated.
 * @param {number} value - The amount to be added to the property.
 * @param {number} [step=0] - This is added to the `value` amount, multiplied by the iteration counter.
 * @param {integer} [index=0] - An optional offset to start searching from within the items array.
 * @param {integer} [direction=1] - The direction to iterate through the array. 1 is from beginning to end, -1 from end to beginning.
