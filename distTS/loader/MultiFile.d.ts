/**
 * @classdesc
 * A MultiFile is a special kind of parent that contains two, or more, Files as children and looks after
 * the loading and processing of them all. It is commonly extended and used as a base class for file types such as AtlasJSON or BitmapFont.
 *
 * You shouldn't create an instance of a MultiFile directly, but should extend it with your own class, setting a custom type and processing methods.
 *
 * @class MultiFile
 * @memberOf Phaser.Loader

 * @since 3.7.0

 * @param {Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin} loader - The Loader that is going to load this File.
 * @param {string} type - The file type string for sorting within the Loader.
 * @param {string} key - The key of the file within the loader.
 * @param {Phaser.Loader.File[]} files - An array of Files that make-up this MultiFile.
