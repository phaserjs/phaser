/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Input Manager is responsible for handling the pointer related systems in a single Phaser Game instance.
 *
 * Based on the Game Config it will create handlers for mouse and touch support.
 *
 * Keyboard and Gamepad are plugins, handled directly by the InputPlugin class.
 *
 * It then manages the event queue, pointer creation and general hit test related operations.
 *
 * You rarely need to interact with the Input Manager directly, and as such, all of its properties and methods
 * should be considered private. Instead, you should use the Input Plugin, which is a Scene level system, responsible
 * for dealing with all input events for a Scene.
 *
 * @class InputManager
 * @memberOf Phaser.Input
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Game} game - The Game instance that owns the Input Manager.
 * @param {object} config - The Input Configuration object, as set in the Game Config.
