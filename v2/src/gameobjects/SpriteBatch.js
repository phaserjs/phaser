/**
* The SpriteBatch class is a really fast version of the DisplayObjectContainer built purely for speed, so use when you need a lot of sprites or particles.
* It's worth mentioning that by default sprite batches are used through-out the renderer, so you only really need to use a SpriteBatch if you have over
* 1000 sprites that all share the same texture (or texture atlas). It's also useful if running in Canvas mode and you have a lot of un-rotated or un-scaled
* Sprites as it skips all of the Canvas setTransform calls, which helps performance, especially on mobile devices.
*
* Please note that any Sprite that is part of a SpriteBatch will not have its bounds updated, so will fail checks such as outOfBounds.
*
* @class Phaser.SpriteBatch
* @extends Phaser.Group
* @constructor
* @param {Phaser.Game} game - A reference to the currently running game.
* @param {Phaser.Group|Phaser.Sprite|null} parent - The parent Group, DisplayObject or DisplayObjectContainer that this Group will be added to. If `undefined` or `null` it will use game.world.
* @param {string} [name=group] - A name for this Group. Not used internally but useful for debugging.
* @param {boolean} [addToStage=false] - If set to true this Group will be added directly to the Game.Stage instead of Game.World.
