        <h1>Getting started with Phaser</h1>

        <h2>Part 7 - The Phaser Examples</h2>

        <p>Phaser comes with a comprehensive suite of examples. At the current count over 160 of them. They are short self-contained snippets of code that focus on just a couple of elements and nothing more, and as such they're really useful to learn from! Whenever we add a new feature into Phaser we create an example to demonstrate how to use it, so there are all kinds of examples from simple things like loading audio to sprite animation and input handling.</p>

        <p>Although we've uploaded the Examples to our site we still recommend that you copy the whole phaser folder (the entire repository) to your webroot, so you can easily run the Examples locally. If you've copied the phaser folder into your webroot then you can access the examples at:</p>

        <code>http://localhost/phaser/examples</code>

        <p>Note: The URL above will differ based on your server set-up.</p>

        <h3>Side by side</h3>

        <p>There are two ways to explore the examples. The default view is a big long list and each new example opens in a new page. There is also a 'Side View', a link to which you'll find at the top of the page. This puts all of the examples in a list down the left and the content and code loads into a frame on the right. Each one has its advantages, so play around and explore!</p>
