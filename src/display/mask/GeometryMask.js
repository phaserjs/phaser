/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Geometry Mask can be applied to a Game Object to hide any pixels of it which don't intersect
 * a visible pixel from the geometry mask. The mask is essentially a clipping path which can only
 * make a masked pixel fully visible or fully invisible without changing its alpha (opacity).
 *
 * A Geometry Mask uses a Graphics Game Object to determine which pixels of the masked Game Object(s)
 * should be clipped. For any given point of a masked Game Object's texture, the pixel will only be displayed
 * if the Graphics Game Object of the Geometry Mask has a visible pixel at the same position. The color and
 * alpha of the pixel from the Geometry Mask do not matter.
 *
 * The Geometry Mask's location matches the location of its Graphics object, not the location of the masked objects.
 * Moving or transforming the underlying Graphics object will change the mask (and affect the visibility
 * of any masked objects), whereas moving or transforming a masked object will not affect the mask.
 * You can think of the Geometry Mask (or rather, of its Graphics object) as an invisible curtain placed
 * in front of all masked objects which has its own visual properties and, naturally, respects the camera's
 * visual properties, but isn't affected by and doesn't follow the masked objects by itself.
 *
 * GeometryMask is only supported in the Canvas Renderer.
 * If you want to use geometry to mask objects in WebGL,
 * see {@link Phaser.GameObjects.Components.FilterList#addMask}.
