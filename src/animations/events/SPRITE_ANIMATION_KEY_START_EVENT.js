/**
 * The Sprite Animation Key Start Event.
 * 
 * This event is dispatched by a Sprite when a specific animation starts playing on it.
 * 
 * Listen for it on the Sprite using `sprite.on('animationstart-key', listener)` where `key` is the key of
 * the animation. For example, if you had an animation with the key 'explode' you should listen for `animationstart-explode`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Animations.Events#SPRITE_ANIMATION_KEY_START
 * 
 * @param {Phaser.Animations.Animation} animation - A reference to the Animation that was started on the Sprite.
 * @param {Phaser.Animations.AnimationFrame} frame - The current Animation Frame that the Animation started with.
 * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite} gameObject - A reference to the Game Object on which the animation started playing.
