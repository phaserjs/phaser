/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Animation State Component.
 *
 * This component provides features to apply animations to Game Objects. It is responsible for
 * loading, queuing animations for later playback, mixing between animations and setting
 * the current animation frame to the Game Object that owns this component.
 *
 * This component lives as an instance within any Game Object that has it defined, such as Sprites.
 *
 * You can access its properties and methods via the `anims` property, i.e. `Sprite.anims`.
 *
 * As well as playing animations stored in the global Animation Manager, this component
 * can also create animations that are stored locally within it. See the `create` method
 * for more details.
 *
 * Prior to Phaser 3.50 this component was called just `Animation` and lived in the
 * `Phaser.GameObjects.Components` namespace. It was renamed to `AnimationState`
 * in 3.50 to help better identify its true purpose when browsing the documentation.
 *
 * @class AnimationState
 * @memberof Phaser.Animations

    /**
     * Create one, or more animations from a loaded Aseprite JSON file.
     *
     * Aseprite is a powerful animated sprite editor and pixel art tool.
     *
     * You can find more details at https://www.aseprite.org/
     *
     * To export a compatible JSON file in Aseprite, please do the following:
     *
     * 1. Go to "File - Export Sprite Sheet"
     *
     * 2. On the **Layout** tab:
     * 2a. Set the "Sheet type" to "Packed"
     * 2b. Set the "Constraints" to "None"
     * 2c. Check the "Merge Duplicates" checkbox
     *
     * 3. On the **Sprite** tab:
     * 3a. Set "Layers" to "Visible layers"
     * 3b. Set "Frames" to "All frames", unless you only wish to export a sub-set of tags
     *
     * 4. On the **Borders** tab:
     * 4a. Check the "Trim Sprite" and "Trim Cells" options
     * 4b. Ensure "Border Padding", "Spacing" and "Inner Padding" are all > 0 (1 is usually enough)
     *
     * 5. On the **Output** tab:
     * 5a. Check "Output File", give your image a name and make sure you choose "png files" as the file type
     * 5b. Check "JSON Data" and give your json file a name
     * 5c. The JSON Data type can be either a Hash or Array, Phaser doesn't mind.
     * 5d. Make sure "Tags" is checked in the Meta options
     * 5e. In the "Item Filename" input box, make sure it says just "{frame}" and nothing more.
     *
     * 6. Click export
     *
     * This was tested with Aseprite 1.2.25.
     *
     * This will export a png and json file which you can load using the Aseprite Loader, i.e.:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * function preload ()
     * {
     *     this.load.path = 'assets/animations/aseprite/';
     *     this.load.aseprite('paladin', 'paladin.png', 'paladin.json');
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Once loaded, you can call this method on a Sprite with the 'atlas' key:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * const sprite = this.add.sprite(400, 300);
     *
     * sprite.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin');
     * ```
     *
     * Any animations defined in the JSON will now be available to use on this Sprite and you play them
     * via their Tag name. For example, if you have an animation called 'War Cry' on your Aseprite timeline,
     * you can play it on the Sprite using that Tag name:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * const sprite = this.add.sprite(400, 300);
     *
     * sprite.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin');
     *
     * sprite.play('War Cry');
     * ```
     *
     * When calling this method you can optionally provide an array of tag names, and only those animations
     * will be created. For example:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * sprite.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin', [ 'step', 'War Cry', 'Magnum Break' ]);
     * ```
     *
     * This will only create the 3 animations defined. Note that the tag names are case-sensitive.
     *
     * @method Phaser.Animations.AnimationState#createFromAseprite
     * @since 3.60.0
     *
     * @param {string} key - The key of the loaded Aseprite atlas. It must have been loaded prior to calling this method.
     * @param {string[]} [tags] - An array of Tag names. If provided, only animations found in this array will be created.

     * Generates objects with string based frame names, as configured by the given {@link Phaser.Types.Animations.GenerateFrameNames}.
     *
     * It's a helper method, designed to make it easier for you to extract all of the frame names from texture atlases.
     * If you're working with a sprite sheet, see the `generateFrameNumbers` method instead.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * If you have a texture atlases loaded called `gems` and it contains 6 frames called `ruby_0001`, `ruby_0002`, and so on,
     * then you can call this method using: `this.anims.generateFrameNames('gems', { prefix: 'ruby_', end: 6, zeroPad: 4 })`.
     *
     * The `end` value tells it to look for 6 frames, incrementally numbered, all starting with the prefix `ruby_`. The `zeroPad`
     * value tells it how many zeroes pad out the numbers. To create an animation using this method, you can do:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.anims.create({
     *   key: 'ruby',
     *   repeat: -1,
     *   frames: this.anims.generateFrameNames('gems', {

     *     end: 6,

     *
     * The `end` value tells it to stop after 12 frames. To create an animation using this method, you can do:

     *
     * Note that `start` is optional and you don't need to include it if the animation starts from frame 0.
     *
     * To specify an animation in reverse, swap the `start` and `end` values.
