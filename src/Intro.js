*
* A feature-packed 2D HTML5 game framework born from the smouldering pits of Flixel and
* constructed via plenty of blood, sweat, tears and coffee by Richard Davey (@photonstorm).
*
* Phaser uses Pixi.js for rendering, created by Mat Groves http://matgroves.com/ @Doormat23.

*
* Many thanks to Adam Saltsman (@ADAMATOMIC) for releasing Flixel, from both which Phaser
* and my love of game development originate.
