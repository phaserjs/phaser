/**
 * The File Load Progress Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by the Loader Plugin during the load of a file, if the browser receives a DOM ProgressEvent and
 * the `lengthComputable` event property is true. Depending on the size of the file and browser in use, this may, or may not happen.
 *
 * Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.load.on('fileprogress', listener)`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Loader.Events#FILE_PROGRESS
 * @type {string}
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Loader.File} file - A reference to the File which is loading.
 * @param {number} percentComplete - A value between 0 and 1 indicating how 'complete' this file is.
