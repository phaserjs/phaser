/**
 * The Pointer Move Input Event.
 * 
 * This event is dispatched by the Input Plugin belonging to a Scene if a pointer is moved anywhere.
 * 
 * Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.on('pointermove', listener)`.
 * 
 * The event hierarchy is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. [GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_MOVE]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_MOVE}
 * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_MOVE]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_MOVE}
 * 3. [POINTER_MOVE]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_MOVE}
 * 
 * With the top event being dispatched first and then flowing down the list. Note that higher-up event handlers can stop
 * the propagation of this event.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Input.Events#POINTER_MOVE
 * 
 * @param {Phaser.Input.Pointer} pointer - The Pointer responsible for triggering this event.
 * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject[]} currentlyOver - An array containing all interactive Game Objects that the pointer was over when the event was created.
