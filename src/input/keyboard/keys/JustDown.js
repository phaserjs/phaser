/**
 * The justDown value allows you to test if this Key has just been pressed down or not.
 * 
 * When you check this value it will return `true` if the Key is down, otherwise `false`.
 * 
 * You can only call justDown once per key press. It will only return `true` once, until the Key is released and pressed down again.
 * This allows you to use it in situations where you want to check if this key is down without using an event, such as in a core game loop.
