/**
 * The Global Key Up Event.
 * 
 * This event is dispatched by the Keyboard Plugin when any key on the keyboard is released.
 * 
 * Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.keyboard.on('keyup', listener)`.
 * 
 * You can also listen for a specific key being released. See [Keyboard.Events.KEY_UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:KEY_UP} for details.
 * 
 * Finally, you can create Key objects, which you can also listen for events from. See [Keyboard.Events.UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:UP} for details.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#ANY_KEY_UP
 * 
 * @param {KeyboardEvent} event - The native DOM Keyboard Event. You can inspect this to learn more about the key that was released, any modifiers, etc.
