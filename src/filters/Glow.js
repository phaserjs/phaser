/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Glow Filter controller.
 *
 * This filter controller manages the glow effect for a Camera.
 *
 * The glow effect is a visual technique that creates a soft, luminous halo around game objects,
 * characters, or UI elements. This effect is used to emphasize importance, enhance visual appeal,
 * or convey a sense of energy, magic, or otherworldly presence. The effect can also be set on
 * the inside of edges. The color and strength of the glow can be modified.
 *
 * A Glow effect is added to a Camera via the FilterList component:
 *
 * ```js
 * const camera = this.cameras.main;
 *
 * camera.filters.internal.addGlow();
 * camera.filters.external.addGlow();
 * ```
 *
 * Conversion note from Phaser 3:
 * - The shader now uses stochastic sampling instead of sampling along straight lines. This improves quality, especially around corners.
 * - `scale` has been added to the parameter list, before `knockout`.
 * - `quality` is no longer a fraction, but an integer value. The default has changed from 0.1 to 10. This is not a linear conversion, because of the quality improvement. Judge the quality by eye and adjust the value accordingly.
 *
 * @class Glow
 * @extends Phaser.Filters.Controller
 * @memberof Phaser.Filters
 * @constructor
 * @since 4.0.0
 * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The camera that owns this filter.
 * @param {number} [color=0xffffff] - The color of the glow effect as a number value.
 * @param {number} [outerStrength=4] - The strength of the glow outward from the edge of textures.
 * @param {number} [innerStrength=0] - The strength of the glow inward from the edge of textures.
 * @param {number} [scale=1] - The scale of the glow effect. This multiplies the fixed distance.
 * @param {boolean} [knockout=false] - If `true` only the glow is drawn, not the texture itself.
 * @param {number} [quality=10] - The quality of the glow effect. This cannot be changed after the filter has been created.
 * @param {number} [distance=10] - The distance of the glow effect. This cannot be changed after the filter has been created.
