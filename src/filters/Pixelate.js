/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Pixelate Filter Controller.
 *
 * This filter controller manages the pixelate effect for a Camera.
 * The pixelate effect is a visual technique that deliberately reduces the resolution or detail of an image,
 * creating a blocky or mosaic appearance composed of large, visible pixels. This effect can be used for stylistic
 * purposes, as a homage to retro gaming, or as a means to obscure certain elements within the game, such as
 * during a transition or to censor specific content.
 *
 * A Pixelate effect is added to a Camera via the FilterList component:
 *
 * ```js
 * const camera = this.cameras.main;
 * camera.filters.internal.addPixelate();
 * ```
 *
 * @class Pixelate
 * @memberof Phaser.Filters
 * @constructor
 * @since 4.0.0
 * @extends Phaser.Filters.Controller
 * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The Camera that owns this filter.
 * @param {number} [amount=1] - The amount of pixelation to apply.
