/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Camera.
 *
 * The Camera is the way in which all games are rendered in Phaser. They provide a view into your game world,
 * and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
 *
 * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
 *
 * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
 * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
 * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
 * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
 *
 * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
 * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
 * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
 *
 * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
 * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis.
 *
 * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash and Camera Shake.
