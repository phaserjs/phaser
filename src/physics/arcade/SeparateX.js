/**
 * Separates two overlapping bodies on the X-axis (horizontally).
 *
 * Separation involves moving two overlapping bodies so they don't overlap anymore and adjusting their velocities based on their mass. This is a core part of collision detection.
 *
 * The bodies won't be separated if there is no horizontal overlap between them, if they are static, or if either one uses custom logic for its separation.
 *
 * @function Phaser.Physics.Arcade.SeparateX
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body1 - The first Body to separate.
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body2 - The second Body to separate.
 * @param {boolean} overlapOnly - If `true`, the bodies will only have their overlap data set and no separation will take place.
 * @param {number} bias - A value to add to the delta value during overlap checking. Used to prevent sprite tunneling.
 *
 * @return {boolean} `true` if the two bodies overlap horizontally, otherwise `false`.
