 * @function Phaser.Physics.Arcade.GetOverlapY
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body1 - The first Body to separate.
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body} body2 - The second Body to separate.
 * @param {boolean} overlapOnly - Is this an overlap only check, or part of separation?
 * @param {number} bias - A value added to the delta values during collision checks. Increase it to prevent sprite tunneling(sprites passing through another instead of colliding).

 * @return {number} The amount of overlap.
