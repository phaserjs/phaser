 * The Game Blur Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by the Game Visibility Handler when the window in which the Game instance is embedded
 * enters a blurred state. The blur event is raised when the window loses focus. This can happen if a user swaps
 * tab, or if they simply remove focus from the browser to another app.
