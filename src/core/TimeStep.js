/**
 * @classdesc
 * The core runner class that Phaser uses to handle the game loop. It can use either Request Animation Frame,
 * or SetTimeout, based on browser support and config settings, to create a continuous loop within the browser.
 *
 * Each time the loop fires, `TimeStep.step` is called and this is then passed onto the core Game update loop,
 * it is the core heartbeat of your game. It will fire as often as Request Animation Frame is capable of handling
 * on the target device.
 *
 * Note that there are lots of situations where a browser will stop updating your game. Such as if the player
 * switches tabs, or covers up the browser window with another application. In these cases, the 'heartbeat'
 * of your game will pause, and only resume when focus is returned to it by the player. There is no way to avoid
 * this situation, all you can do is use the visibility events the browser, and Phaser, provide to detect when
 * it has happened and then gracefully recover.

     * means that more recent seconds affect the estimated frame rate more than
     * older seconds.
     *
     * When a browser window is NOT minimized, but is covered up (i.e. you're using
     * another app which has spawned a window over the top of the browser), then it
     * will start to throttle the raf callback time. It waits for a while, and then
     * starts to drop the frame rate at 1 frame per second until it's down to just over 1fps.
     * So if the game was running at 60fps, and the player opens a new window, then
     * after 60 seconds (+ the 'buffer time') it'll be down to 1fps, so rafin'g at 1Hz.

     * When they make the game visible again, the frame rate is increased at a rate of
     * approx. 8fps, back up to 60fps (or the max it can obtain)

     * There is no easy way to determine if this drop in frame rate is because the
     * browser is throttling raf, or because the game is struggling with performance
     * because you're asking it to do too much on the device.
