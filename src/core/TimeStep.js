/**
 * @classdesc
 * The core runner class that Phaser uses to handle the game loop. It can use either Request Animation Frame,
 * or SetTimeout, based on browser support and config settings, to create a continuous loop within the browser.
 * 
 * Each time the loop fires, `TimeStep.step` is called and this is then passed onto the core Game update loop,
 * it is the core heartbeat of your game. It will fire as often as Request Animation Frame is capable of handling
 * on the target device.
 * 
 * Note that there are lots of situations where a browser will stop updating your game. Such as if the player
 * switches tabs, or covers up the browser window with another application. In these cases, the 'heartbeat'
 * of your game will pause, and only resume when focus is returned to it by the player. There is no way to avoid
 * this situation, all you can do is use the visibility events the browser, and Phaser, provide to detect when
 * it has happened and then gracefully recover.
