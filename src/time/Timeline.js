/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Timeline is a way to schedule events to happen at specific times in the future.
 *
 * You can think of it as an event sequencer for your game, allowing you to schedule the
 * running of callbacks, events and other actions at specific times in the future.
 *
 * A Timeline is a Scene level system, meaning you can have as many Timelines as you like, each
 * belonging to a different Scene. You can also have multiple Timelines running at the same time.
 *
 * If the Scene is paused, the Timeline will also pause. If the Scene is destroyed, the Timeline
 * will be automatically destroyed. However, you can control the Timeline directly, pausing,
 * resuming and stopping it at any time.
 *
 * Create an instance of a Timeline via the Game Object Factory:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline();
 * ```
 *
 * The Timeline always starts paused. You must call `play` on it to start it running.
 *
 * You can also pass in a configuration object on creation, or an array of them:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline({
 *     at: 1000,
 *     run: () => {
 *         this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo');
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * timeline.play();
 * ```
 *
 * In this example we sequence a few different events:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline([
 *     {
 *         at: 1000,
 *         run: () => { this.logo = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo'); },
 *         sound: 'TitleMusic'
 *     },
 *     {
 *         at: 2500,
 *         tween: {
 *             targets: this.logo,
 *             y: 600,
 *             yoyo: true
 *         },
 *         sound: 'Explode'
 *     },
 *     {
 *         at: 8000,
 *         event: 'HURRY_PLAYER',
 *         target: this.background,
 *         set: {
 *             tint: 0xff0000
 *         }
 *     }
 * ]);
 *
 * timeline.play();
 * ```
 *
 * The Timeline can also be looped with the repeat method:
 * ```js
 * timeline.repeat().play();
 * ```
 * 
 * There are lots of options available to you via the configuration object. See the
 * {@link Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig} typedef for more details.

/**
 * A Timeline is a way to schedule events to happen at specific times in the future.
 *
 * You can think of it as an event sequencer for your game, allowing you to schedule the
 * running of callbacks, events and other actions at specific times in the future.
 *
 * A Timeline is a Scene level system, meaning you can have as many Timelines as you like, each
 * belonging to a different Scene. You can also have multiple Timelines running at the same time.
 *
 * If the Scene is paused, the Timeline will also pause. If the Scene is destroyed, the Timeline
 * will be automatically destroyed. However, you can control the Timeline directly, pausing,
 * resuming and stopping it at any time.
 *
 * Create an instance of a Timeline via the Game Object Factory:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline();
 * ```
 *
 * The Timeline always starts paused. You must call `play` on it to start it running.
 *
 * You can also pass in a configuration object on creation, or an array of them:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline({
 *     at: 1000,
 *     run: () => {
 *         this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo');
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * timeline.play();
 * ```
 *
 * In this example we sequence a few different events:
 *
 * ```js
 * const timeline = this.add.timeline([
 *     {
 *         at: 1000,
 *         run: () => { this.logo = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'logo'); },
 *         sound: 'TitleMusic'
 *     },
 *     {
 *         at: 2500,
 *         tween: {
 *             targets: this.logo,
 *             y: 600,
 *             yoyo: true
 *         },
 *         sound: 'Explode'
 *     },
 *     {
 *         at: 8000,
 *         event: 'HURRY_PLAYER',
 *         target: this.background,
 *         set: {
 *             tint: 0xff0000
 *         }
 *     }
 * ]);
 *
 * timeline.play();
 * ```
 *
 * The Timeline can also be looped with the repeat method:
 * ```js
 * timeline.repeat().play();
 * ```
 * 
 * There are lots of options available to you via the configuration object. See the
 * {@link Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig} typedef for more details.
 *
 * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#timeline
 * @since 3.60.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig|Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig[]} config - The configuration object for this Timeline Event, or an array of them.
