/**
* A Timer is a way to create small re-usable or disposable objects that do nothing but wait for a specific moment in time, and then dispatch an event.
* You can add as many events to a Timer as you like, each with their own delays. A Timer uses milliseconds as its unit of time. There are 1000 ms in 1 second.
* So if you want to fire an event every quarter of a second you'd need to set the delay to 250.
