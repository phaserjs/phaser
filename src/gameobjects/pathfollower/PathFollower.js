/**
 * @classdesc
 * A PathFollower Game Object.
 *
 * A PathFollower is a Sprite Game Object with some extra helpers to allow it to follow a Path automatically.
 *
 * Anything you can do with a standard Sprite can be done with this PathFollower, such as animate it, tint it,
 * scale it and so on.
 *
 * PathFollowers are bound to a single Path at any one time and can traverse the length of the Path, from start
 * to finish, forwards or backwards, or from any given point on the Path to its end. They can optionally rotate
 * to face the direction of the path, be offset from the path coordinates or rotate independently of the Path.
 *
 * @class PathFollower
 * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite
 * @memberof Phaser.GameObjects
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.PathFollower
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene - The Scene to which this PathFollower belongs.
 * @param {Phaser.Curves.Path} path - The Path this PathFollower is following. It can only follow one Path at a time.
 * @param {number} x - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} y - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {(string|Phaser.Textures.Texture)} texture - The key, or instance of the Texture this Game Object will use to render with, as stored in the Texture Manager.
 * @param {(string|number)} [frame] - An optional frame from the Texture this Game Object is rendering with.
