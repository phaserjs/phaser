/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Sprite Game Object.
 *
 * A Sprite Game Object is used for the display of both static and animated images in your game.
 * Sprites can have input events and physics bodies. They can also be tweened, tinted, scrolled
 * and animated.
 *
 * The main difference between a Sprite and an Image Game Object is that you cannot animate Images.
 * As such, Sprites take a fraction longer to process and have a larger API footprint due to the Animation
 * Component. If you do not require animation then you can safely use Images to replace Sprites in all cases.

     * Animations in Phaser can either belong to the global Animation Manager, or specifically to this Sprite.

     * The benefit of a global animation is that multiple Sprites can all play the same animation, without
     * having to duplicate the data. You can just create it once and then play it on any Sprite.

     * ```
     *
     * However, if you wish to create an animation that is unique to this Sprite, and this Sprite alone,
     * you can call the `Animation.create` method instead. It accepts the exact same parameters as when
     * creating a global animation, however the resulting data is kept locally in this Sprite.
     *
     * With the animation created, either globally or locally, you can now play it on this Sprite:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.sprite(x, y).play('run');
     * ```

     * object instead:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.sprite(x, y).play({ key: 'run', frameRate: 24 });
     * ```

     * locally within the Sprite. If it can, it will play the local animation. If not, it will then

     * have conflicting keys.
