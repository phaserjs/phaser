/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Render Texture is a combination of Dynamic Texture and an Image Game Object, that uses the
 * Dynamic Texture to display itself with.
 *
 * A Dynamic Texture is a special texture that allows you to draw textures, frames and most kind of
 * Game Objects directly to it.
 *
 * You can take many complex objects and draw them to this one texture, which can then be used as the
 * base texture for other Game Objects, such as Sprites. Should you then update this texture, all
 * Game Objects using it will instantly be updated as well, reflecting the changes immediately.
 *
 * It's a powerful way to generate dynamic textures at run-time that are WebGL friendly and don't invoke
 * expensive GPU uploads on each change.
 *
 * In versions of Phaser before 3.60 a Render Texture was the only way you could create a texture
 * like this, that had the ability to be drawn on. But in 3.60 we split the core functions out to
 * the Dynamic Texture class as it made a lot more sense for them to reside in there. As a result,
 * the Render Texture is now a light-weight shim that sits on-top of an Image Game Object and offers
 * proxy methods to the features available from a Dynamic Texture.
 *
 * **When should you use a Render Texture vs. a Dynamic Texture?**
 *
 * You should use a Dynamic Texture if the texture is going to be used by multiple Game Objects,
 * or you want to use it across multiple Scenes, because textures are globally stored.
 *
 * You should use a Dynamic Texture if the texture isn't going to be displayed in-game, but is
 * instead going to be used for something like a mask or shader.
 *
 * You should use a Render Texture if you need to display the texture in-game on a single Game Object,
 * as it provides the convenience of wrapping an Image and Dynamic Texture together for you.
 *
 * Under WebGL1, a FrameBuffer, which is what this Dynamic Texture uses internally, cannot be anti-aliased.
 * This means that when drawing objects such as Shapes or Graphics instances to this texture, they may appear
 * to be drawn with no aliasing around the edges. This is a technical limitation of WebGL1. To get around it,
 * create your shape as a texture in an art package, then draw that to this texture.
