/**
 * Creates a new Arc Shape Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
 *
 * Note: This method will only be available if the Arc Game Object has been built into Phaser.
 * 
 * The Arc Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
 * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
 * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
 * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
 * 
 * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
 * 
 * When it renders it displays an arc shape. You can control the start and end angles of the arc,
 * as well as if the angles are winding clockwise or anti-clockwise. With the default settings
 * it renders as a complete circle. By changing the angles you can create other arc shapes,
 * such as half-circles.
 *
 * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#arc
 * @since 3.13.0
 *
 * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} [radius=128] - The radius of the arc.
 * @param {integer} [startAngle=0] - The start angle of the arc, in degrees.
 * @param {integer} [endAngle=360] - The end angle of the arc, in degrees.
 * @param {boolean} [anticlockwise=false] - The winding order of the start and end angles.
 * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the arc will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.
 * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the arc will be filled with. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its `alpha` property.
 *
 * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.Arc} The Game Object that was created.
