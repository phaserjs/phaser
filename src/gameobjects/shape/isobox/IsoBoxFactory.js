/**
 * Creates a new IsoBox Shape Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
 *
 * Note: This method will only be available if the IsoBox Game Object has been built into Phaser.
 * 
 * The IsoBox Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
 * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
 * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
 * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
 * 
 * This shape supports only fill colors and cannot be stroked.
 * 
 * An IsoBox is an 'isometric' rectangle. Each face of it has a different fill color. You can set
 * the color of the top, left and right faces of the rectangle respectively. You can also choose
 * which of the faces are rendered via the `showTop`, `showLeft` and `showRight` properties.
 * 
 * You cannot view an IsoBox from under-neath, however you can change the 'angle' by setting
 * the `projection` property.
 *
 * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#isobox
 * @since 3.13.0
 *
 * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} [size=48] - The width of the iso box in pixels. The left and right faces will be exactly half this value.
 * @param {number} [height=32] - The height of the iso box. The left and right faces will be this tall. The overall height of the isobox will be this value plus half the `size` value.
 * @param {number} [fillTop=0xeeeeee] - The fill color of the top face of the iso box.
 * @param {number} [fillLeft=0x999999] - The fill color of the left face of the iso box.
 * @param {number} [fillRight=0xcccccc] - The fill color of the right face of the iso box.
 *
 * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.IsoBox} The Game Object that was created.
