/**
 * @classdesc
 * A list of filters being applied to a {@link Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera}.
 *
 * Filters can apply special effects and masks.
 * They are only available in WebGL.
 * Use `gameObject.enableFilters()` to apply them to Game Objects.
 *
 * Filters include the following:
 *
 * * Barrel Distortion
 * * Blur
 * * Blend
 * * Bokeh / Tilt Shift
 * * Color Matrix
 * * Displacement
 * * Glow
 * * Mask
 * * Parallel Filters
 * * Pixelate
 * * Sampler
 * * Shadow
 * * Threshold
 *
 * This list is either 'internal' or 'external'.
 * Internal filters apply to things within the camera.
 * External filters apply to the camera itself, in its rendering context.
 * A complete list of rendering steps for a Camera goes:
 *
 * 1. Objects render to a texture the size of the camera.
 * 2. Internal filters draw that texture to new textures, applying effects.
 *   These are usually the same size, but may expand to accommodate blur.
 * 3. The texture is drawn to a texture the size of the context where the camera
 *   will be drawn, accounting for transformation of the camera itself.
 * 4. External filters draw that texture to new textures,
 *   again applying effects and expanding where necessary.
 * 5. The final texture draws the filtered camera contents to the context.
 *
 * For example, consider a game object which is rotated 45 degrees.
 * Apply a horizontal blur filter.
 * If the filter is internal, the blur will appear at 45 degrees,
 * because it is applied before the object is rotated.
 * If the filter is external, the blur will appear horizontal,
 * because it is applied after the object is rotated.
 *
 * You should use internal filters wherever possible,
 * because they apply only to the region of the camera/game object.
 * External filters are full-screen and can be more expensive.
 *
 * Filters can be stacked. The order of the list is the order of application.
 *
 * As you can appreciate, some effects are more expensive than others. For example, a bloom effect is going to be more
 * expensive than a simple color matrix effect, so please consider using them wisely and performance test your target
 * platforms early on in production.
 *
 * This FilterList is created internally and does not need to be instantiated directly.
 *
 * In Phaser 3, Filters were known as FX.
