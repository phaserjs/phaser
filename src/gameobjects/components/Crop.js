     * Applies a crop to a texture based Game Object, such as a Sprite or Image.
     * 
     * The crop is a rectangle that limits the area of the texture frame that is visible during rendering.
     * 
     * Cropping a Game Object does not change its size, dimensions, physics body or hit area, it just
     * changes what is shown when rendered.
     * 
     * The crop coordinates are relative to the texture frame, not the Game Object, meaning 0 x 0 is the top-left.
     * 
     * Therefore, if you had a Game Object that had an 800x600 sized texture, and you wanted to show only the left
     * half of it, you could call `setCrop(0, 0, 400, 600)`.
     * 
     * It is also scaled to match the Game Object scale automatically. Therefore a crop rect of 100x50 would crop
     * an area of 200x100 when applied to a Game Object that had a scale factor of 2.
     * 
     * You can either pass in numeric values directly, or you can provide a single Rectangle object as the first argument.
     * 
     * Call this method with no arguments at all to reset the crop, or toggle the property `isCropped` to `false`.
     * 
     * You should do this if the crop rectangle becomes the same size as the frame itself, as it will allow
     * the renderer to skip several internal calculations.
