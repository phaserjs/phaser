/**
* An Image is a light-weight object you can use to display anything that doesn't need physics or animation.
* It can still rotate, scale, crop and receive input events. This makes it perfect for logos, backgrounds, simple buttons and other non-Sprite graphics.
*
* @class Phaser.GameObject.Image
* @extends Phaser.GameObject
* @constructor
* @param {Phaser.Game} game - A reference to the currently running game.
* @param {number} [x=0] - The x coordinate of the Image. The coordinate is relative to any parent container this Image may be in.
* @param {number} [y=0] - The y coordinate of the Image. The coordinate is relative to any parent container this Image may be in.
* @param {string} [key] - The texture used by the Image during rendering. It can be a string which is a reference to the Cache entry, or an instance of a RenderTexture, BitmapData or PIXI.Texture.
* @param {string|number} [frame] - If this Image is using part of a sprite sheet or texture atlas you can specify the exact frame to use by giving a string or numeric index.
