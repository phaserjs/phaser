# Phaser - HTML5 Game Framework

Welcome to Phaser 3!

**Phaser 3 is not yet ready for production use**

If you want to help build Phaser 3 then check out our new [Getting Started Guide](dev-guide/README.md). I stress this isn't a guide on how to make Phaser 3 games, it's a guide on how to set-up your dev environment so you can assist us in _building Phaser 3 itself_.

Also please join the [Phaser 3 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) mailing list. We are posting there frequently, asking for suggestions and getting help and feedback from the community, so it'd be great to have you there too.

You are of course welcome to clone the source, play around, and mess with it as much as you like. But understand it's changing every single day.

Every Friday we publish the [Phaser World](http://phaser.io/community/newsletter) newsletter, and part of each issue contains our 'Development Progress' articles. These are condensed summaries of what we've been working on during the week.

If you want to follow development on a casual basis, the newsletter is perfect. If you want a blow-by-blow account of development, then Watch this repo, join the mailing list, and be prepared for the influx of emails that'll generate :)

Cheers,

Developing Phaser takes a lot of time, effort, and money. There are monthly running costs; such as the forum and site, which we maintain 100% ad-free. As well as countless hours of development time, community support, and assistance resolving issues. We do this out of our love for Phaser of course, but at the end of the day there are real tangible costs involved.

If you have found Phaser useful in your development life. Or have made income as a result of using it, and are in a position to support us financially, without causing any detriment to yourself, then please do. There are a number of ways:

* A monthly contribution via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). 
* A [one-off donation](http://phaser.io/community/donate) via PayPal.
* Purchase any of our [plugins or books](http://phaser.io/shop).
* Companies can sponsor a release of Phaser, or an issue of our newsletter.
 
It all helps cover our running costs, and genuinely contributes towards future development.

If you would like to sponsor Phaser then please [get in touch](mailto:support@phaser.io). We have sponsorship options available on our GitHub repo, web site, and newsletter. All of which receive tens of thousands of eyeballs per day.
