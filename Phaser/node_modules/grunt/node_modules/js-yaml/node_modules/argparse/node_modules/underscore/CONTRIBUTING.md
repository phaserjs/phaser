## How to contribute to Underscore.js

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have [tests](http://underscorejs.org/test/).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js).

* In your pull request, do not add documentation or re-build the minified `underscore-min.js` file. We'll do those things before cutting a new release.
