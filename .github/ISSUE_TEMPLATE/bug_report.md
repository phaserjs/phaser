All issues must have source code demonstrating the problem. We automatically close issues after 30 days if no code is provided.

The code can be pasted directly below this comment, or you can link to codepen, jsbin, or similar. The code will ideally be runnable instantly. The more work involved in turning your code into a reproducible test case, the longer it will take the fix the issue.
