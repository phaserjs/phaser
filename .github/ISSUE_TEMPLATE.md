Before opening this issue _please_ check we haven't already fixed it! Development always takes place in the Phaser `dev` branch. The easiest way to check is to read the [Dev Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/dev#change-log).

This Issue is about (delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API
* An error in the documentation
* An error in the TypeScript defs
* An error on the web site
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, sometimes not ever.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.
**Be nice.**
