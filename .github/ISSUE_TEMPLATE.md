Before opening this issue _please_ check we haven't already fixed it! Check the [Dev Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/v2-community/#change-log).

This Issue is about (delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API (always say which version you're using!)
* An error in the documentation
* An error in the TypeScript defs
* An error on the web site
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_.

If the issue is in a current version of Phaser, then you can use the [Phaser Sandbox](http://phaser.io/sandbox) to demonstrate it. Otherwise feel free to use another service, such as jsbin. If we can run it, and see the error, we can usually fix it.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.

**Be nice. We do this for free.**
