**This repo is for Phaser 3 related issues only**

Official support for Phaser 2 has now ended. We urge you to visit the [Phaser CE (Community Edition)](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) for continued development of v2.

This Issue is about (delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API (always say which version you're using!)
* An error in the documentation
* An error in the TypeScript defs
* An error on the web site
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_. Feel free to use a site such as jsBin or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen?template=YeEWom) to demo the problem. If we can run it, and see the error, we can usually fix it.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.

**Be nice. We do this for free.**
