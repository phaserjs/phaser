Copyright Warning
=================

Do not use any of the graphics or music found in this folder in your own games.

You are free to use them for testing and prototypes, but do not release them in a commercial game.
That includes games sold on MarketJS, or any game running advertisements such as via Google or Leadbolt.

Why? because lots of the graphics in here come from commercial games themselves.

For example sprites borrowed from Xenon 2, Metal Slug, Dig Dug and various console and Amiga games.

These graphics are still owned by their copyright holders, and using them in something seen to be making money
is a really bad idea on your part, ok?

Plus, it's just not cool.
