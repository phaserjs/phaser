# Change Log

There is an extensive [Migration Guide](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/resources/Migration%20Guide.md) available for those converting from Phaser 1.x to 2.x. In the guide we detail the API breaking changes and approach to our new physics system.

## Version 2.0.5 - "Tanchico" - 20th May 2014

### Updates

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @luispedrofonseca @clark-stevenson @Anahkiasen @adamholdenyall @luispedrofonseca @WillHuxtable)
* Input.getPointerFromIdentifier docs update to reflect where the identifier comes from. Pointer properties now set to give it fixed defaults (thanks @JirkaDellOro, #793)
* Pointer.pointerId added which is set by the DOM event (if present in the browser). Note that browsers can and do recycle pointer IDs.
* Pointer.type and Pointer.exists properties added.
* QuadTree.retrieve can now accept either a Sprite with a physics body or a Phaser.Rectangle as its parameter.
* PluginManager.add now accepts additional parameters and if given a function it will pass them all to the Plugin constructor.
* Tilemap.getTile has a new nonNull parameter. If true it won't return `null` for empty tiles, but will return the actual Tile in that location.
* Math.interpolateAngles and Math.nearestAngleBetween have been removed for the time being. They threw run-time errors previously.
* PIXI.InteractionManager is no longer over-written if the object already exists (thanks @georgiee, #818)
* Key.justPressed and justReleased incorrectly set the delay value to 2500ms. Now defaults to 50ms (thanks @draklaw, fix #797)
* Stage.backgroundColor can now accept short-code hex values: `#222`, `#334`, etc.
* Pointer.withinGame is now accurate based on game scale and updated as the Pointer moves.
* Stage.bounds is now updated if the game canvas offset changes position. Note that it contains the un-scaled game dimensions.

### New Features

* New `force` parameter added to Group.set, setAll, setAllChildren, setProperty which controls if a property is created even if it doesn't exist.
* Group.hasProperty will check a child for the given property and return true if it exists, otherwise false.
* Phaser.Tween.from allows you to set tween properties that will end up where the current object is (thanks @codevinsky, #792)
* Input.getPointerFromId will return a pointer with a matching pointerId value, if any. pointerId is a value set by the browser in the DOM event.
* ArcadePhysics.getObjectsUnderPointer will return all children from a Group that overlap with the given Pointer.
* InputManager.minPriorityID lets you set the minimum priority level an object needs to be to be checked by a Pointer. Useful for UI layer stacking.

* BitmapData.processPixelRGB added undefined check (thanks @muclemente, fix #808)
* Phaser.Utils.transposeArray will transpose the given array and return it.
* Phaser.Utils.rotateArray will rotate the given array by 90 or 180 degrees in either direction and return it.
* BitmapData.rect provides a quick way to draw a Rectangle to a BitmapData.
* Button.onOverMouseOnly is a boolean that causes onOver events to fire only if the pointer was a mouse (i.e. stops onOver sounds triggering on touch)
* Tilemap.setCollision has a new boolean parameter 'recalculate' which lets you control recalculation of collision faces (thanks @max-m, #819)
* Tilemap.setCollisionBetween has a new boolean parameter 'recalculate' which lets you control recalculation of collision faces (thanks @max-m, #819)
* Tilemap.setCollisionByExclusion has a new boolean parameter 'recalculate' which lets you control recalculation of collision faces (thanks @max-m, #819)

* Input.deleteMoveCallback will remove a previously set movement event callback.
* Mouse will now check if it's over the game canvas or not and set Pointer.withinGame accordingly.
* Mouse.mouseOutCallback callback added for when the mouse is no longer over the game canvas.
* Mouse.stopOnGameOut boolean controls if Pointer.stop will be called if the mouse leaves the game canvas (defaults to false)
* Tilemap.searchTileIndex allows you to search for the first tile matching the given index, with optional skip and reverse parameters.
* Tilemap.layer is a getter/setter to the current layer object (which can be changed with Tilemap.setLayer)

### Bug Fixes

* Line.pointOnLine corrected algorithm (thanks @woutercommandeur, fix #784)
* Line segment collision fails under certain cicumstances (thanks @woutercommandeur, fix #760)

* Timer class updated so that code-resumed pauses don't mess up the internal _pausedTotal value (thanks @joelrobichaud, fix #814)
* Timer class when paused by code after a game-level pause wouldn't set the codepaused flag (thanks @joelrobichaud, fix #814)
* Stage.backgroundColor now properly accepts hex #RRGGBB and color values 0xRRGGBB again (fix #785)
* Color.getRGB would return incorrect color components if a color value without alpha was given, now works with both 0xRRGGBB and 0xAARRGGBB.
* Color.getWebRGB now works regardless if you give an 0xRRGGBB or 0xAARRGGBB color value.

* RetroFont.text would throw WebGL errors due to an issue with Pixi.RenderTexture. Fixed in Phaser and submitted code to Pixi.
* RenderTexture.resize would throw WebGL errors due to an issue with Pixi.RenderTexture. Fixed in Phaser and submitted code to Pixi.
* Group.hasProperty fixed to not use hasOwnProperty, but a series of `in` checks (thanks @mgiuffrida for the idea, #829)

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @clark-stevenson @metrofun @killalau)
* Timer has removed all use of local temporary vars in the core update loop.
* The Input.reset `hard` reset parameter is now passed down to the Keyboard and Key reset methods.
* AnimationManager.destroy now iterates through child animations calling destroy on all of them, avoiding a memory leak (thanks stauzs)
* AnimationManager.play will now call Animation.stop on the current animation before switching to the new one (thanks @nihakue, #713)
* ArcadePhysics.Body.phase is checked in postUpdate to prevent it from being called multiple times in a single frame.
* Group.setProperty will now check if the property exists before setting it, this applies to Group.setAll and anything else using setProperty internally.
* QuadTree.retrieve now checks to see if the given Sprite has a body before carrying on.
* ArcadePhysics.collideSpriteVsGroup checks if Sprite has a body before carrying on, now safely skips sub-groups or other non-Sprite group children. 
* Group.remove now checks the child to see if it's a member of the root Group before removing it, otherwise Pixi throws an Error.
* The Emitter no longer checks if minParticleScale = maxParticleScale for the scale check, allowing for fixed scale particles again.
* The PIXI.AbstractFilter is now included in the Phaser Pixi build by default, allowing for easier use of external Pixi Filters.
* All Game Objects have a new property: destroyPhase (boolean) which is true if the object is in the process of being destroyed, otherwise false.
* If Tween.yoyo was true but repeat was 0 then it wouldn't yoyo. Now if yoyo is set, but not repeat, the repeat count gets set to 1 (thanks @hilts-vaughan, fix #744)
* RandomDataGenerator.integerInRange uses a new method of rounding the value to an integer to avoid distribution probability issues (thanks PhaserFan)
* Updated the Device little / big endianess check.
* Time has been updated so that physicsElapsed can never be zero (falls back to 1/60), also fixes p2 elapsed time bug (thanks @georgiee, fix #758)
* Input and Pointer now use the new ArrayList instead of a LinkedList, which resolve list item removable during callback issues.
* Input.reset no longer resets every interactive item it knows of, because they are removed during the destroy phase and can now persist between States if needed.
* Blank Tilemaps no longer create `null` tiles, but instead create Tile objects with an index of -1 which can be replaced and updated like any other tile.
* Tilemap.addTilesetImage will now raise a console.warn if you specify an invalid tileset key and not create the tileset rather than pick the default set.
* Math.smoothstep and Math.smootherstep have been updated to work regardless if a is > or < b (thanks @gre, fix #772)
* Text.updateText now sets the lineCap to `round` to avoid occassional font glitching issues in Chrome.
* Loader now uses XDomainRequest in IE9 to load JSON data to help with CORS issues.

* World.wrap will take a game object and if its x/y coordinates fall outside of the world bounds it will be repositioned on the opposite side, for a wrap-around effect.
* Device.support32bit is a new boolean that sets if the context supports 32bit pixel manipulation using array buffer views or not.
* P2.World now has its own pause and resume methods, so you can pause the physics simulation independent of your game (thanks @georgiee)

## Version 2.0.3 - "Allorallen" - 11th April 2014

### Updates

* Updated to [Pixi.js 1.5.2](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/releases/tag/v1.5.2)

* Fix for 'jagged' strokes on custom fonts (thanks @nickryall, #677)
* The State.update function (and thus the update of any sub-classed Sprites or other objects) is now called before Stage, Tweens, Sound, Input, etc (#662)
* The Phaser jshint process is now running on Travis (thanks @xtian, #656)
* The Phaser Gruntfile is now split up into option tasks (thanks @xtian, #638)
* Key.reset now clears any callbacks associated with the onDown and onUp events and nulls the onHoldCallback if set. Key.reset is called by Keyboard.reset when changing state.

* TypeScript definitions updated for latest changes (thanks @clark-stevenson)
* Keyboard.stop nulls the function references after removing the event listeners (thanks @bmceldowney, #691)
* Tilemap.hasTile allows for multi-layer type parameter (thanks @Raeven0, #680)

* Sound.destroy will remove a sound and all local references it holds, optionally removing itself from the SoundManager as well.
* SoundManager.removeByKey(key) will remove all sounds from the SoundManager that have a key matching the given value.
* ArcadePhysics.Body.hitTest(x, y) will return a boolean based on if the given world coordinate are within the Body or not.
* StateManager.restart allows you to quickly restart the *current* state, optionally clearing the world and cache.
* Tilemap.removeTile(x, y, layer) lets you remove the tile at the given coordinates and updates the collision data.
* Tilemap.removeTileWorldXY lets you remove the tile at the given pixel value coordinates and updates the collision data.
* Key.enabled boolean allows you to toggle if a Key processes its update method or dispatches any events without deleting and re-creating it.
* Emitter now has minParticleAlpha and maxParticleAlpha values for setting a random alpha on emitted particles.
* Emitter.particleAnchor allows you to control the anchor of emitted Particles. Defaults to 0.5 (same as before) but now under your control.
* Emitter.setAlpha allows you to quickly set the min and max alpha values.
* Emitter.setScale allows you to quickly set the min and max scale values.
* Emitter.blendMode lets you set the blendMode of any emitted Particle (needs a browser that supports canvas blend modes)
* Group.customSort allows you to sort the Group children based on your own sort function.
* Emitter.setScale has a new 'rate' parameter which allows particles to change in scale over time, using any Easing value or timescale.
* Emitter.setScale now allows you to scale the x and y axis of the particles independently.
* Emitter.setAlpha has a new 'rate' parameter which allows particles to change alpha over time, using any Easing value or timescale.
* Emitter.bringToTop and Emitter.sendToBack are booleans that let you optionally set the display order of the Particle when emitted.
* Emitter now calls the Phaser.Particle.onEmit function, which is left empty for you to override and add in custom behaviours.
* p2.World has a new contactMaterial property, which can be configured like a normal P2 Contact Material and is applied when two bodies hit that don't have defined materials.
* Group.remove has a new 'destroy' parameter (false by default), which will optionally call destroy on the item removed from the Group.
* Group.removeAll has a new 'destroy' parameter (false by default), which will optionally call destroy on the items removed from the Group.
* Group.removeBetween has a new 'destroy' parameter (false by default), which will optionally call destroy on the items removed from the Group.
* @georgiee created a new P2.FixtureList class to allow easy access the fixtures of a created P2 Body:

This is especially useful in combination with PhysicsEditor and P2.Body#addPhaserPolygon.

You can configure your whole collision grouping in PhysicsEditor and then you can later change the mask bits easily with this class. You can also access parts (groups) and named fixtures by a group index or a fixture key - both properties can be set in PhysicsEditor with the custom phaser exporter.

Use cases:

* Configure collision bits in PhysicsEditor and you want to change them later.
* Place a sensor in your fixture and access this single fixture later (to disable temporarily)
* Create a small body with threes fixtures (circle, circle + polygon/convex). Now you want that the polygon part to behave like rubber and assign a bouncing (restitution > 1) material. Assign a fixture key in PhysicsEditor and access the fixture like this. (see the image for the fixture I described)

## Version 2.0.2 - "Ghealdan" - 28th March 2014

### Bug Fixes

* Sprite would glitch if it had an ArcadePhysics Body that was re-positioned out of loop.
* Sprite would "fly off" if it had an ArcadePhysics Body that was re-positioned during an input handler.
* Tween.generateData would enter an eternal loop if the total resulted in a float. Now wrapped in Math.floor.
* ArcadePhysics.Body preUpdate has been modified to stop Sprites with non-1 scaling from gaining delta and moving off the screen (fix #644).
* ArcadePhysics.Body deltaMaxY wasn't being correctly applied.
* P2.World - Removing tilemap layer retrieval for object layers in convertCollisionObjects() (thanks bmceldowney, fix #653)
* Calling Keyboard.stop() wouldn't let you call Keyboard.start() later on in the same game

### Updated

* The "Build your First Phaser Game" Tutorial has been updated for Phaser 2
* Line.fromSprite now sets "fromCenter" to false by default as Sprite.center is deprecated in 2.x. Documentation and Examples updated to reflect this.
* All the documentation has been re-published for 2.0.2.
* Lots of ArcadePhysics.World methods have been marked as private where they shouldn't be called directly (separateX, etc)
* xtian jshint fixed nearly every single file in the repository!

### New Features

* Sprite.overlap lets you quickly check to see if the bounds of two display objects are intersecting or not, without having to use a physics system.
* Keyboard.destroy will now clear all event listeners and any custom set callbacks or Keys.



## Version 2.0.1 - "Lyrelle" - 24th March 2014

### Bug Fixes

* The Static, Kinematic and Dynamic consts that P2.Body uses were incorrect (fixes #563)
* Sprite.destroy would fail if it had an Arcade Physics body, now added.
* Group.getAt comparison updated (fixes #578)
* Fixed the IE11 version check (fixes #579)
* Ninja world collision to check right and bottom bounds (thanks dreadhorse, fix #571)
* Group enableBody parameter was incorrectly assigned to the debug var (thanks BurnedToast, fix #565)
* Fixed Tile callback check in Arcade Physics (fix #562)
* Removed the examples build script from the Gruntfile (fix #592)
* The P2 World wouldn't clear down fully on a State change, now properly clears out contacts, resets the bitmask, etc.
* Button.onInputUpHandler wouldn't set an upFrame for a frame ID of zero, made the check more strict.
* Fixed the Loader.preloadSprite crop effect on WebGL.
* Fixed Grunt script that stopped the P2 constraint classes from building properly.
* World.destroy incorrectly clashed with the Group.destroy method it over-rode, renamed to World.shutdown and updated StateManager accordingly.
* World.shutdown now removes all children iteratively, calling destroy on each one, ultimately performing a soft reset of the World.
* Objects with a scale.x or y of 0 are no longer considered valid for input (fix #602)
* InputHandler will set the browser pointer back to default if destroyed while over (fix #602)
* ArcadePhysics.separate doesn't pass over to seperateX/Y if overlapOnly is true (fix #604)
* ArcadePhysics.collideSpriteVsSprite checks if both objects have bodies before processing.
* Debug.spriteBounds will now take the position of the camera into consideration when rendering the bounds (fix #603)
* InputHandler.dragFromCenter will now work regardless of the anchor point of the Sprite (fix #600)
* Emitter.friction property removed and replaced with Emitter.particleDrag, which is now correctly applied.
* ArcadePhysics.Body.reset incorrectly set the Body.rotation to Sprite.rotation instead of angle.
* Emitter.emitParticle resets the rotation on the particle to zero before emitting it.
* If no seed was given in the Game config object, the RandomDataGenerator wouldn't be started (thank tylerjhutchison fix #619)
* p2 revolute pivots were wrongly signed (thanks georgiee, fix #621)
* P2.Body.loadPolygon no longer modifies the Cache array (fix #613)
* The volume given in Sound.play now over-rides that set in Sound.addMarker if specified (fix #623)
* BitmapDatas when used as Game Object textures in WebGL now update themselves properly.
* Timer.ms now correctly reports the ms time even if the Timer has been paused (thanks Nambew, fix #624)
* If you added a Tileset to an empty map it would eventually throw an out of memory error.
* Timer objects incorrectly set the first tick value on events if you added the events prior to starting them.

### Updated

* Updated Device.isConsoleOpen as it no longer works in Chrome. Revised code and documentation accordingly (fix #593)
* Removed State.destroy empty method and replaced with State.shutdown, as that is what the StateManager expects (fix #586)
* P2.removeBody will check if the body is part of the world before removing, this avoids a TypeError from the p2 layer.
* Tilemap.createFromObjects has a new parameter: adjustY, which is true by default. Because Tiled uses a bottom-left coordinate system Phaser used to set the Sprite anchor to 0,1 to compensate. If adjustY is true it now reduces the y value by the object height instead.
* Swapped the order of the _pollGamepads gamepads check, to stop the Chrome 'webkitGamepads is deprecated' error in the console.
* Lots of TypeScript definitions updates (thanks as always to clark for these)
* Removed Device.patchAndroidClearRectBug as it's no longer used internally.
* Math.wrapAngle now supports radians (thanks Cryszon, #597)
* Group.replace will now return the old child, the one that was replaced in the Group.
* Group.destroy has a new parameter: `soft`. A soft destruction won't remove the Group from its parent or null game references. Default is `false`.
* InputHandler.validForInput is a new method that checks if the handler and its owner should be considered for Pointer input handling or not.
* ArcadePhysics.Body now checks the ArcadePhysics.World bounds, not the game bounds.
* ArcadePhysics.Body has reverted to the 1.1.3 method of preUpdate, so you can now position sprites with x/y, drag them, etc, regardless of the Body.moves flag (issue #606)
* ArcadePhysics.World now has setBounds and setBoundsToWorld methods, which are called automatically on world resizing.
* ArcadePhysics.Body no longer sets the offset to match the anchor.
* The StateManager is now responsible for clearing down input, timers, tweens, physics, camera and the World display list.
* Removed the use of Int16Array from all Game Objects, swapped for standard Array. Phaser now runs on Android 2.x and IE9 again (fix #590)
* When creating a Sprite (via Group.create or directly) with exists = false and a P2 body, the body is not added to the world.
* Every Input class now checks to see if it has already been started. If so it doesn't add the listeners again unless they have been nulled.
* Lots of fixes to the TypeScript definitions file (thanks as always to clark-stevenson for his tireless work on these)
* Emitters now bring the particle they are about to emit to the top of the Group before doing so. Avoids particles hidden behind others.
* ArcadePhysics.Body.setSize corrected to take the parameters as positive, not negative values.
* ArcadePhysics.World.seperate will now check gravity totals to determine separation order. You can set World.forceX to true to always separate on X first and skip this check.
* TileSprites now emit outOfBounds and enterBounds events accordingly.
* You can now create multiple blank layers in a Tilemap.

### New Features

* Device.getUserMedia boolean added, useful if you need access to the webcam or microphone.
* Math.removeRandom allows you to remove (and return) a random object from an array.
* ArcadePhysics.World now has a checkCollision object which can be used to toggle collision against the 4 walls of its bounds.
* Sprite.events.onEnterBounds added. This is dispatched if the Sprite leaves the bounds but then returns. The opposite of onOutOfBounds.
* Timer.removeAll will remove and clear down all events, but keeps the Timer running.
* Group.setAllChildren recursively checks if its children are Groups, and if so recursively applies the value to their children as well (feature #589)
* Time.deltaCap lets you set a cap for the delta timer. It defaults to zero (which is disabled). If you use ArcadePhysics it gets set to 0.2, but you can modify as needed.
* ArcadePhysics.Body has a deltaMax object, which allows you to cap the delta applied to the position to +- this value.
* ArcadePhysics.Body now checks the Sprite scale automatically and adjusts the body size accordingly (fix #608)
* Emitter.particleClass can now be set to any object that extends Phaser.Sprite, which will be emitted instead of a regular Sprite.
* There is a brand new PhysicsEditor export script specifically for Phaser (in the resources folder), and new p2 polygon parsing functions thanks to georgiee.



## Version 2.0.0 - "Aes Sedai" - March 13th 2014

### New Features

* Phaser.Image is a brand new display object perfect for logos, backgrounds, etc. You can scale, rotate, tint, blend an get input events from an Image, but it has no animation or physics body.
* You can now use the hitArea property on Sprites and Image objects. hitArea can be a geometry object (Rectangle, Circle, Polygon, Ellipse) and is used in pointerOver checks.
* InputManager.getLocalPosition(displayObject, pointer, output) will return the local coordinates of the specified displayObject and pointer.
* InputManager.hitTest will test for pointer hits against a Sprite/Image, its hitArea (if set) or any of its children.
* Text has lots of new methods to help style it: Text.fill, Text.align, Text.stroke, etc.
* Text now works happily with font names with spaces in them.
* Text.setShadow applies a drop shadow to the Text being rendered. Control the x, y, color and blur.
* Text.lineSpacing allows you to set additional spacing between each line that is rendered.
* Text.inputEnabled allows you to enable all input events over Text objects: dragging, clicking, etc - anything that works on a Sprite works on Text now too.
* Phaser.Ellipse added. A fully compatible port of the PIXI.Ellipse class, can be used in Sprite/Image hitArea tests.
* Phaser.Polygon added. A fully compatible port of the PIXI.Polygon class, can be used in Sprite/Image hitArea tests.
* InputHandler.pixelPerfectOver - performs a pixel perfect check to see if any pointer is over the current object (warning: very expensive!)
* InputHandler.pixelPerfectClick - performs a pixel perfect check but only when the pointer touches/clicks on the current object.
* TileSprite can now use a frame from a texture atlas or a sprite sheet.
* TileSprites can now be animated. See new example :)
* TileSprites have a new method: autoScroll(x, y) which sets an automatic scroll running (until stopped with TileSprite.stopScroll).
* BitmapText now uses the new XML parser which should work under CocoonJS without clashes.
* BitmapText signature changed so you can support fonts with spaces in their names.
* Loader.bitmapFont now has 2 extra parameters: xSpacing and ySpacing. These allow you to add extra spacing to each letter or line of the font.
* Added the new RetroFont class. This is for rendering fixed-width bitmap fonts into an Image object. It's a texture you can apply to a Sprite/Image.
* Added Cache.updateFrameData which is really useful for swapping FrameData blocks in the cache.
* Loader.physics now lets you load Lime + Corona JSON Physics data, which can be used with Body.loadPolygon and Body.loadData.
* Cache.addPhysicsData and Cache.getPhysicsData allow you to store parsed JSON physics data in the cache, for sharing between Bodies.
* fixedToCamera now works across all display objects. When enabled it will fix at its current x/y coordinate, but can be changed via cameraOffset.
* fixedToCamrea now works for Groups as well :) You can fix a Group to the camera and it will influence its children.
* Tilemap.createCollisionObjects will parse Tiled data for objectgroups and convert polyline instances into physics objects you can collide with in the world.
* Loader can now load JSON files specifically (game.load.json) and they are parsed and stored in the Game.Cache. Retrieve with game.cache.getJSON(key).
* TileSprites can now receive full Input events, dragging, etc and be positioned in-world and fixed to cameras.
* The StateManager now looks for a function called 'resumed' which is called when a game un-pauses.
* Key.onHold added. This event is dispatched every time the browser sends a keydown event and the key is already being held down.
* Stage.smoothed allows you to set if sprites will be smoothed when rendered. Set to false if you're using pixel art in your game. Default is true. Works in Canvas and WebGL.
* Sprite.smoothed and Image.smoothed allows you to set per-Sprite smoothing, perfect if you just want to keep a few sprites smoothed (or not)
* StateManager.start can now have as many parameters as you like. The order is: start(key, clearWorld, clearCache, ...) - they are passed to State.init() (NOT create!)
* Loader.script now has callback (and callbackContext) parameters, so you can specify a function to run once the JS has been injected into the body.
* Phaser.Timer.stop has a new parameter: clearEvents (default true), if true all the events in Timer will be cleared, otherwise they will remain (fixes #383)
* All GameObjects now have a 'destroyChildren' boolean as a parameter to their destroy method. It's default is true and the value propogates down its children.
* Pixi GrayFilter ported over (thanks nickryall #404)
* Animation.speed added. You can now change the animation speed on the fly, without re-starting the animation (feature request #458)
* Brand new Grunt task - creates each core library as its own file and a combined phaser.js.
* New build script now cleanly splits Phaser, Pixi and p2 so they are each UMD wrapped and each available in the global scope (now more requireJS friendly!).
* phaser-no-libs.js allows you to use your own version of p2.js or pixi.js with Phaser. Warning: This is totally unsupported. If you hit bugs, you fix them yourself.
* Group.sendToBottom(child) is the handy opposite of Group.bringToTop()
* Group.moveUp(child) will move a child up the display list, swapping with the child above it.
* Group.moveDown(child) will move a child down the display list, swapping with the child below it.
* Device.windowsPhone is now tested for.
* The Debug panel now works in WebGL mode. Pay attention to the warning at the top of the Debug docs (feature request #499)
* You can now create blank Tilemaps and then populate them with data later.
* A single Animation object now has 3 new events: onStart, onLoop and onComplete.
* Animation.loopCount holds the number of times the animation has looped since it last started.
* Tween.generateData(frameRate) allows you to generate tween data into an array, which can then be used however you wish (see new examples)
* Group.xy(index, x, y) allows you to set the x and y coordinates of a Group child at the given index.
* Group.reverse() reverses the display order of all children in the Group.
* Tweens are now bound to their own TweenManager, not always the global game one. So you can create your own managers now (for you clark :)
* ScaleManager.fullScreenTarget allows you to change the DOM element that the fullscreen API is called on (feature request #526)
* Merged Georges p2 BodyDebug and reformatted for jshint pass. Looks awesome :)
* ArcadePhysics.Body has a new gravityScale property, which is a modifier multiplied against the world gravity value on a Body.
* Line.coordinatesOnLine will return all coordinates on the line using Bresenhams line algorithm.
* Line now has x, y, width, height, top, bottom, left and right properties, so you can effectively get its bounds.
* TilemapLayer.getRayCastTiles will let you get all tiles that hit the given line for further processing.

### Updates

* Massive thanks to clark-stevenson for doing an amazing job update the TypeScript definitions file.
* Debug.renderRectangle has a new parameter: filled. If true it renders as with fillRect, if false strokeRect.
* Phaser.AnimationParser now sets the trimmed data directly for Pixi Texture frames. Tested across JSON Hash, JSON Data, Sprite Sheet and XML.
* Game.add.renderTexture now has the addToCache parameter. If set the texture will be stored in Game.Cache and can be retrieved with Cache.getTexture(key).
* Game.add.bitmapData now has the addToCache parameter. If set the texture will be stored in Game.Cache and can be retrieved with Cache.getBitmapData(key).
* The InputManager now sets the canvas style cursor to 'inherit' instead of 'default'.
* World.reset now calls Camera.reset which sends the camera back to 0,0 and un-follows any object it may have been tracking.
* Added hostname: '*' to the grunt-connect in Gruntfile.js (fixes #426)
* Device, Canvas and GamePad classes all updated for better CocoonJS support (thanks Videlais)
* BitmapData.alphaMask will draw the given image onto a BitmapData using an image as an alpha mask.
* The new GameObjectCreator (which you access via game.make or State.make) lets you easily create an object but NOT add it to the display list.
* TilemapParser will now throw a warning if the tileset image isn't the right size for the tile dimensions.
* We now force IE11 into Canvas mode to avoid a Pixi bug with pre-multiplied alpha. Will remove once that is fixed, sorry, but it's better than no game at all, right? :(
* Loader.setPreloadSprite() will now set sprite.visible = true once the crop has been applied. Should help avoid issues (#430) on super-slow connections.
* Updated the way the page visibility is checked, should now be more compatible across more browsers.
* Phaser.Input.Key.isUp now defaults to 'true', as does GamepadButton.isUp (#474)
* Vastly improved visibility API support + pageshow/pagehide + focus/blur. Working across Chrome, IE, Firefox, iOS, Android (also fixes #161)
* Pausing the game will now mute audio and resuming will un-mute, unless it was muted via the game (fixes #439)
* ScaleManager has 2 new events: ScaleManager.enterFullScreen and ScaleManager.leaveFullScreen, so you can respond to fullscreen changes directly.
* RandomDataGenerator.integerInRange(min, max) now includes both `min` and `max` within its range (#501)
* Tween no longer copies all the object properties into the `_valuesStart` object on creation.
* Completely empty Tilemaps can now be created. This allows for dynamic map generation at runtime.
* Keyboard.event now stores the most recent DOM keyboard event.
* Animation.stop has a new parameter: dispatchComplete. If true it'll dispatch an Animation.onComplete event.
* TileSprites now have a physics body property and call it in the pre and post updates. As with all physics bodies it's null by default.
* json is now the default tilemap format when not defined (thanks RyanDansie, #528)
* The Particle Emitter now remembers the frames given to it and resets it when a new particle is emitted.
* Game.focusLoss and focusGain methods and onBlur and onFocus Signals added, allowing for more fine-grained control over game pause vs. focus loss.
* Keyboard.removeKey method added (thanks qdrj, #550)
* Key.event now stores the most recent DOM event that triggered it.

### Bug Fixes

* Explicitly paused Timer continues if you un-focus and focus the browser window (thanks georgiee)
* Added TimerEvent.pendingDelete and checks in Timer.update, so that removing an event in a callback no longer throws an exception (thanks georgiee)
* Fixed TypeScript defs on lines 1741-1748 (thanks wombatbuddy)
* Previously if you used Sprite.crop() it would crop all Sprites that shared the same base image. It now takes a local copy of the texture data and crops just that.
* Tilemap had the wrong @method signatures so most were missing from the docs.
* Fixed bug where changing State would cause the camera to not reset if it was following an object.
* Tile had 2 properties (callback and callbackContext) that were never assigned, updated to use the proper names (thanks ratkingsimon)
* Fixed an error that would occur if you used InputHandler.onInputUp and the Sprite destroys itself during the event.
* IE11 didn't populate the Device.ie## Version value. Now extracted from Trident revision, but still use Device.trident instead for IE11+ checks.
* Fixed bug in Math.angleBetween where it was using the coordinates in the wrong order.
* Previously using a Pixel Perfect check didn't work if the Sprite was rotated or had a non-zero anchor point, now works under all conditions + atlas frames.
* If pixelPerfect Input Sprites overlapped each other the pixel check wasn't taken into consieration in the Pointer move method.
* Updated Input.Mouse to use event.button not event.which, so the const reference from input.mouse.button is correct (thanks grimor)
* Text that was fixedToCamera would 'jitter' if the world scrolled. Now works as expected across all fixed objects.
* Fixed a bug where Sound.play wouldn't pick-up the local loop setting if not specified in the parameter.
* Active animations now monitor if the game pauses, and resume normally when the game un-pauses (fixes #179)
* Swapping between tabs will now pause the game correctly on mobile browsers (iOS7+)
* Swapping between tabs will pause and resume tweens correctly, allowing their onComplete events to still fire (fixes #292)
* Fullscreen mode now uses window.outerWidth/Height when using EXACT_FIT as the scale mode, which fixes input coordinate errors (fixes #232)
* Fullscreen mode now works in Internet Explorer and uses the new fullscreen non-prefix call.
* Fixed TilemapParser - would spit out a tileset warning if margin/spacing were set (fix #485, thanks Cybolic)
* AnimationParser.spriteSheet wasn't taking the margin or spacing into account when calculating the numbers of sprites per row/column, nor was it allowing for extra power-of-two padding at the end (fix #482, thanks yig)
* AnimationManager.add documentation said that 'frames' could be null, but the code couldn't handle this so it defaults to an empty array if none given (thanks yig)
* Fixed issue stopping SoundManager.volume from working correctly on a global volume basis (fixes #488)
* Phaser.Timer will no longer create negative ticks during game boot, no matter how small the Timer delay is (fixes #366)
* Phaser.Timer will no longer resume if it was previously paused and the game loses focus and then resumes (fixes #383)
* Tweens now resume correctly if the game pauses (focus loss) while they are paused.
* Tweens don't double pause if they were already paused and the game pauses.
* Buttons are now cleanly destroyed if part of a Group without leaving their InputHandler running.
* You can now safely destroy a Group and the 'destroyChildren' boolean will propogate fully down the display list.
* Calling destroy on an already destroyed object would throw a run-time error. Now checked for and aborted.
* Calling destroy while in an Input Event callback now works for either the parent Group or the calling object itself.
* Loader.replaceInFileList wouldn't over-write the previous entry correctly, which caused the Loader.image overwrite parameter to fail (thanks basoko, fixes #493)
* If the game was set to NO_SCALE and you swapped orientation, it would pause and resize, then fail to resize when you swapped back (thanks starnut, fixes #258)
* Device no longer things a Windows Phone or Windows Tablet are desktop devices (thanks wombatbuddy, fixes #506)
* Sound.onMarkerComplete event is now dispatched when a marker stops. See Sound.onLoop for a looping marker event (thanks registered99, fixes #500)
* Events.onInputUp would be dispatched twice if the Sprite had drag enabled, now only dispatched once (thanks Overbryd, fixes #502)
* You can now load in CSV Tilemaps again and they get created properly (fixes #391)
* Tilemap.putTile can now insert a tile into a null/blank area of the map (before it could only replace existing tiles)
* Tilemap.putTile now correctly re-calculates the collision data based on the new collideIndexes array (fixes #371)
* Circle.circumferencePoint using the asDegrees parameter would apply degToRad instead of radToDeg (thanks Ziriax, fixes #509)
* InputHandler.enableSnap now correctly assigns the snap offset parameters (fixes #515)
* Objects that are 'fixedToCamera' are now still correctly placed even if the camera is scaled (#512)
* Changed the define function calls to use named modules, allows pixi, phaser and p2 to reside in 1 file and still be located by requirejs (thanks brejep, #531)
* Cache.destroy fixed to clear up properly (thanks Dumtard, #537)



## Version 1.1.5 - "Saldaea" - 12th February 2014

### Bug Fixes

* Explicitly paused Timer continues if you un-focus and focus the browser window (thanks georgiee)
* Added TimerEvent.pendingDelete and checks in Timer.update, so that removing an event in a callback no longer throws an exception (thanks georgiee)
* Fixed TypeScript defs on lines 1741-1748 (thanks wombatbuddy)
* Added SAT.js to TypeScript definition. Now compiles properly.
* Added missing Line.js to the Grunt file.
* Tilemap#paste diffX and diffY equations changed, fixed issue #393 (thanks brejep)
* Added missing return value in Body.hitLeft and hitRight, fixes issue #398 (thanks ram64).
* Fixed easing tween example case. Issue #379 (thanks wesleywerner)
* Removed SAT.js UMD wrapped, fixes issue #361 (thanks luizbills)
* Removed inContact check from Body.separate.
* Fixed Tilemap docs (wrongly pointed to Tileset methods)



## Version 1.1.4 - "Kandor" - February 5th 2014

### Significant API changes

* Loader.tileset has been removed as it's no longer required, this was as part of the Tilemap system overhaul.
* TilemapLayers are now created via the Tilemap object itself: map.createLayer(x, y, width, height, tileset, layer, group) and no longer via the GameObjectFactory.
* Tilemap.createFromObjects can now turn a bunch of Tiled objects into Sprites in one single call, and copies across all properties as well.
* Tween.onStartCallback and onCompleteCallback have been removed to avoid confusion. You should use the onStart, onLoop and onComplete events instead.
* Button.forceOut default value has changed from true to false, so Buttons will revert to an Up state (if set) when pressed and released.
* The way the collision process callback works has changed significantly and now works as originally intended.
* The World level quadtree is no longer created, they are now built and ripped down each time you collide a Group, this helps collision accuracy.
* A SAT system has been integrated for Body collision and separation.
* Bodies are no longer added to a world quadtree, so have had all of their quadtree properties removed such as skipQuadtree, quadTreeIndex, etc.
* Body.drag has been removed. Please use the new Body.linearDamping value instead (which is a number value, not a Point object)
* Body.embedded and Body.wasTouching have been removed as they are no longer required.
* Body.customSeparateX/Y have been removed as you should now use Body.customSeparateCallback.
* Body.maxVelocity defaults have been removed from 10,000 to 2000.
* Body.customSeparateCallback allows you to set your own callback when two Bodies need to separate rather than using the built-in method.
* Body.collideCallback allows you to set a callback that is fired whenever the Body is hit on any of its active faces.
* Body.allowCollision has been renamed to Body.checkCollision.
* Body.rebound is a boolean that controls if a body will exchange velocity on collision. Set to false to allow it to be 'pushed' (see new examples).
* Removed Body.deltaAbsX and deltaAbsY as they are no longer used internally.
* Body.screenX and screenY moved to getters, no longer calculated every frame.
* ArcadePhysics now has setBounds and setBoundsToWorld, and you can specify which walls are created or not (left, right, up, down)
* Removed: Debug.renderSpriteTouching, Debug.renderLocalTransformInfo, Debug.renderWorldTransformInfo, Debug.renderSpriteCollision and Debug.dumpLinkedList.
* Body.setSize has been removed. Please use Body.setCircle, setRectangle or setPolygon instead.

### New Features

* Phaser.Timer is now feature complete and fully documented. You can create Phaser.TimerEvents on a Timer and lots of new examples have been provided.
* Gamepad API support has been added with lots of new examples (thanks Karl Macklin)
* Phaser.Game constructor can now be passed a single object containing all of your game settings + Stage settings. Useful for advanced configurations.
* The width/height given to Phaser.Game can now be percentages, i.e. "100%" will set the width to the maximum window innerWidth.
* Added a stage.fullScreenScaleMode property to determine scaling when fullscreen (thanks oysterCrusher)
* Added support for margin and spacing around a frame in Loader.spritesheet.
* Added Device.vibration to check if the Vibration API is available or not.
* Added Device.trident and Device.trident## Version for testing IE11.
* Added Device.silk for detecting a Kindle Fire and updated desktop OS check to exclude Kindles (thanks LuckieLordie)
* TilemapLayers now have debug and debugAlpha values, this turns on the drawing of the collision edges (very handy for debugging, as the name implies!)
* Tweens have a new event: onLoop.
* You can now load any binary file via the Loader: game.load.binary(key, url, callback) - the optional callback allows for post-load processing before entering the Cache.
* Group.set will let you deep set a new propery on a single child of the Group.
* Stage.display property added. A direct reference to the root Pixi Stage object (very useful for RenderTexture manipulation)
* Added Ejecta detection to Device (thanks endel)
* Tweens can now work with relative + and - values. You can do: `tween(sprite).to( { x: '+400' })` and it will add 400 to the current sprite.x value.
* Buttons now properly use their upFrame if set.
* InputHandler now has snapOffsetX and snapOffsetY properties so your snap grid doesn't have to be 0,0 aligned (thanks srmeier)
* Loader.progressFloat contains the actual non-rounded progress value, where-as Loader.progress contains a rounded value. Use progressFloat if you've > 100 files to load.
* Groups can now be added to other Groups as children via group.add() and group.addAt()
* Groups now have an 'alive' property, which can be useful when iterating through child groups with functions like forEachAlive.
* Added a new Project Template "Full Screen Mobile" which you can find in the resources folder. Contains html / css / layout needed for a deployed Phaser game.
* Body.speed - the current speed of the body.
* Body.angle - the current angle the Body is facing based on its velocity. This is not the same as the Sprite angle that may own the body.
* Body.linearDamping - This now replaces Body.drag and provides for a much smoother damping (friction) experience.
* Body.minBounceVelocity - If a Body has bounce set, this threshold controls if it should rebound or not. Use it to stop 'jittering' on bounds/tiles with super-low velocities.
* QuadTree.populate - you can pass it a Group and it'll automatically insert all of the children ready for inspection.
* Input.setMoveCallback allows you to set a callback that will be fired each time the activePointer receives a DOM move event.
* Math.distancePow(x1,y1,x2,y2,power) returns the distance between two coordinates at the given power.
* Physics.collide now supports the 2nd parameter as an array, for when you want to collide an object against a number of sprites that aren't all in the same Group.
* Physics.overlap now supports the 2nd parameter as an array, for when you want to overlap test an object against a number of sprites that aren't all in the same Group.
* Math.reverseAngle - reverses an angle (in radians).
* Math.normalizeAngle - normalises an angle, now in radians only.
* Math.normalizeLatitude - Normalizes a latitude to the [-90,90] range.
* Math.normalizeLongitude - Normalizes a longitude to the [-180,180] range.
* Phaser.Line added to the geometry classes, with full point on line/segment and intersection tests (see new examples)
* Phaser.CANVAS_PX_ROUND is a boolean. If 'true' the Canvas renderer will Math.floor() all coordinates before drawImage, stopping pixel interpolation. Defaults to false.
* Phaser.CANVAS_CLEAR_RECT is a boolean. If 'true' (the default) it will context.clearRect() every frame. If false this is skipped (useful if you know you don't need it)
* Collision now works between Sprites positioned via sprite.x/y, sprite.body.x/y or sprite.body.velocity.
* If you are tweening a sprite and still want physics collision, set `sprite.body.moves = false` otherwise it will fight against the tween motion.
* Game.enableStep will enable core game loop stepping. When enabled you must call game.step() directly (perhaps via a DOM button?), very useful for debugging!
* Game.disableStep turns core update loop stepping off.
* Debug.renderPhysicsBody(body, color) is extremely useful for debugging the new physics bodies. Will draw the outline + points in the color given.
* Debug.renderBodyInfo(sprite, x, y, color) will display lots of Sprite body data.
* Sprite.events.onBeginContact will be fired when a Body makes contact with another Body. Once contact is over an onEndContact event will be dispatched.

### Updates

* Updated to latest Pixi.js dev branch build (pre 1.4 release)
* When a Sprite is destroyed any active filters are removed at the same time.
* Updated Pixi.js so that removing filters now works correctly without breaking the display list.
* Phaser.Canvas.create updated so it can be given an ID as the 3rd parameter (can also be set via new Game configuration object).
* Updated display/fullscreen example to reflect new full screen change.
* Loads of updates to the TypeScript definitions files - games fully compile now and lots of missing classes added :) (thanks Niondir)
* Removed 'null parent' check from Group constructor. Will parent to game.world only if parent value is undefined.
* The tutorials have now been translated into Spanish - thanks feiss :)
* separateY updated to re-implement the 'riding platforms' special condition (thanks cocoademon)
* SoundManager.onSoundDecode now dispatches the key followed by the sound object, also now dispatched by the Cache when doing an auto-decode on load.
* Switch method of using trimmed sprites to support scaling and rotation (thanks cocoademon)
* Most of the GameObjectFactory functions now have a group parameter, so you can do: game.add.sprite(x, y, frame, frameName, group) rather than defaulting to the World group.
* Group.countLiving and countDead used to return -1 if the Group was empty, but now return 0.
* Text can now be fixedToCamera, updated world/fixed to camera example to show this.
* ArcadePhysics.overlap and collide now recognise TileSprites in the collision checks.
* Lots of documentation fixes in the Tween class.
* Tweens fire an onLoop event if they are set to repeat. onComplete is now only fired for the final repeat (or never if the repeat is infinite)
* Pointer used to un-pause a paused game every time it was clicked/touched (this avoided some rogue browser plugins). Now only happens if Stage.disableVisibilityChange is true.
* Input doesn't set the cursor to default if it's already set to none.
* You can now collide a group against itself. This will check all children against each other, but not themselves (thanks cocoademon)
* RenderTexture.render / renderXY has a new parameter: renderHidden, a boolean which will allow you to render Sprites even if their visible is set to false.
* Added in prototype.constructor definitions to every class (thanks darkoverlordofdata)
* Group.destroy has a new parameter: destroyChildren (boolean) which will optionally call the destroy method of all Group children.
* Button.clearFrames method has been added.
* Device.quirksMode is a boolean that informs you if the page is in strict (false) or quirks (true) mode.
* Canvas.getOffset now runs a strict/quirks check and uses document.documentElement when calculating scrollTop and scrollLeft to avoid Chrome console warnings.
* The Time class now has its own Phaser.Timer which you can access through game.time.events. See the new Timer examples to show how to use them.
* Added StateManager.getCurrentState to return the currently running State object (thanks Niondir)
* Removed the console.log redirect from Utils as it was messing with Firefox.
* Body.acceleration is now much smoother and less eratic at high speeds.
* Removed ArcadePhysics binding to the QuadTree, so it can now be used independantly of the physics system.
* Removed ArcadePhysics.preUpdate and postUpdate as neither are needed any more.
* Body.bottom and Body.right are no longer rounded, so will give accurate sub-pixel values.
* Fixed lots of documentation in the Emitter class.
* The delta timer value used for physics calculations has had its cap limit modified from 1.0 to 0.05 in line with the core updates.
* Phaser.Math.min enhanced so you can now pass in either an array of numbers or lots of numbers as parameters to get the lowest.
* Phaser.Math.max added as the opposite of Math.min.
* Phaser.Math.minProperty and maxProperty added. Like Math.min/max but can be given a property an an array or list of objects to inspect.
* Added 'full' paramter to Body.reset, allowing you to control if motion or all data is reset or not.
* Exposed Group.pivot and Sprite.pivot to allow you to directly set the pivot points for rotation.
* Swapped to using the native and faster Array.isArray check.
* Added callback context parameter to Tween.onUpdateCallback(callback, context) to avoid having to bind or create anonymous functions.
* Updated TweenManager.removeAll so it flags all tweens as pendingDelete rather than nuking the array, to avoid tween callback array size errors (thanks DarkDev)

### Bug Fixes

* Cache.getImageKeys returned __missing in the array, now excluded.
* Fixed Group.scale so you can now scale a Group directly.
* Removed World.scale as it was preventing Group.scale from working - you can still scale the world, but you'll need to factor in Input changes yourself.
* Moved 'dirty' flag for Tilemap to a per-layer flag. Fixes #242
* Group.length now returns the number of children in the Group regardless of their exists/alive state, or 0 if the Group has no children.
* Switch Camera.setBoundsToWorld to match world.bounds instead of world (thanks cocoademon)
* Fixed an issue where passing null as the Group parent wouldn't set it to game.world as it should have (thanks tito100)
* Fixed Pixi bug (#425) incorrect width property for multi-line BitmapText (thanks jcd-as)
* Tween.onStart is now called when the tween starts AFTER the delay value, if given (thanks stevenbouma)
* Sprites that are fixedToCamera can now be input dragged regardless of world position (thanks RafaelOliveira)
* RenderTexture now displays correctly in Canvas games.
* Canvas.addToDOM is now more robust when applying the overflowHidden style.
* Fixed Pixi.StripShader which should stop the weird TileSprite GPU issues some were reporting (thanks GoodboyDigital)
* Patched desyrel.xml so it doesn't contain any zero width/height characters, as they broke Firefox 25.
* Cache.addSound now implements a locked attribute (thanks haden)
* Sound now checks for CocoonJS during playback to avoid readyState clash (thanks haden)
* Buttons now clear previously set frames correctly if you call setFrames.
* Sounds will now loop correctly if they are paused and resumed (thanks haden)
* InputHandler.checkBoundsRect and checkBoundsSprite now take into account if the Sprite is fixedToCamera or not.
* Removed the frame property from TileSprites as it cannot use them, it tiles the whole image only, not just a section of it.
* Fixed WebGLRenderer updateGraphics bug (thanks theadam)
* Removed duplicate Timer.create line (thanks hstolte)
* Fixed issue with the camera being slightly out of sync with 'fixedToCamera' sprites.
* 1px camera jitter issue fixed where map is same size, or smaller than the game size.



## Version 1.1.3 - "Arafel" - November 29th 2013

### New Features

* Phaser.Filter. A new way to use the new WebGL shaders/filters that the new version of Pixi supports.
* Phaser.BitmapData object. A Canvas you can freely draw to with lots of functions. Can be used as a texture for Sprites. See the new examples and docs for details.
* The entire Phaser library has been updated to match the new JSHint configuration.
* Added a .jshintrc so contributions can be run through JSHint to help retain formatting across the library (thanks kevinthompson)
* Added a new in-built texture. Sprites now use __default if no texture was provided (a 32x32 transparent PNG) or __missing if one was given but not found (a 32x32 black box with a green cross through it)
* Loader can now load JavaScript files. Just use game.load.script('key', 'url') - the file will be turned into a script tag in the document head on successful load.
* RenderTexture.render now takes a Phaser.Group. Also added renderXY for when you don't want to make a new Point object.
* Physics.overlap now supports Sprites, Groups or Emitters and can perform group vs. group (etc) overlap checks with a custom callback and process handler.
* Added Sound.externalNode which allows you to connect a Sound to an external node input rather than the SoundManager gain node.
* Added SoundManager.connectToMaster boolean. Used in conjunction with Sound.externalNode you can easily configure audio nodes to connect together for special effects.
* PluginManager.remove, added PluginManager.removeAll (thanks crazysam)
* scrollFactorX/scrollFactorY have been added to TilemapLayers (thanks jcd-as)
* Phaser.Game parent can now be an HTMLElement or a string (thanks beeglebug)
* Now using the latest version of Pixi.js. Which means you can use all the sexy new WebGL filters :)
* Sprite.animations.getAnimation will return an animation instance which was added by name.
* Added Mouse.button which is set to the button that was pressed: Phaser.Mouse.LEFT_BUTTON, MIDDLE_BUTTON or RIGHT_BUTTON (thanks wKLV)
* Added Mouse.pointerLock signal which you can listen to whenever the browser enters or leaves pointer lock mode.
* StageScaleMode.forceOrientation allows you to lock your game to one orientation and display a Sprite (i.e. a "please rotate" screen) when incorrect.
* World.visible boolean added, toggles rendering of the world on/off entirely.
* Polygon class & drawPolygon method added to Graphics (thanks rjimenezda)
* Added Group.iterate, a powerful way to count or return children that match a certain criteria. Refactored Group to use iterate, lots of repeated code cut.
* Added Group.sort. You can now sort the Group based on any given numeric property (x, y, health), finally you can do depth-sorting :) Example created to show.
* Enhanced renderTexture so it can accept a Phaser.Group object and improved documentation and examples.
* Device.littleEndian boolean added. Only safe to use if the browser supports TypedArrays (which IE9 doesn't, but nearly all others do)
* You can now call game.sound.play() and simply pass it a key. The sound will play if the audio system is unlocked and optionally destroy itself on complete.
* Mouse.capture is a boolean. If set to true then DOM mouse events will have event.preventDefault() applied, if false they will propogate fully.
* The object returned by Math.sinCosGenerator now contains a length property.

### Updates

* Lots of documentation fixes and updates across nearly all files. Tilemap now documented for example and lots of instances of 'Description' filled out.
* ArcadePhysics.updateMotion applies the dt to the velocity calculations as well as position now (thanks jcs)
* RequestAnimationFrame now retains the callbackID which is passed to cancelRequestAnimationFrame.
* Button now goes back to over state when setFrames used in action (thanks beeglebug)
* plugins now have a postUpdate callback (thanks cocoademon)
* Tided up the Graphics object (thanks BorisKozo)
* If running in Canvas mode and you have a render function it will save the context and reset the transform before running your render function.
* Sprite will now check the exists property of the Group it is in, if the Group.exists = false the Sprite won't update.
* If you specify 'null' as a Group parent it will now revert to using the World as the parent (before only 'undefined' worked)
* Skip preupdate/update for PIXI hierarchies in which an ancestor doesn't exist (thanks cocoademon)
* Loader.audio can now accept either an array of URL strings or a single URL string (thanks crazysam + kevinthompson)
* MSPointer updated to support IE11 by dropping the prefix from the event listeners.
* Device.cocoonJS added to detect if the game is running under Cocoon or a native browser.
* Loader now uses a new queue system internally, meaning you can have assets with the same key spread across different types.

### Bug Fixes

* Lots of fixes to the TypeScript definitions file (many thanks gltovar)
* Tilemap commands use specified layer when one given (thanks Izzimach)
* Mouse.stop now uses the true useCapture, which means the event listeners stop listening correctly (thanks beeglebug)
* Input Keyboard example fix (thanks Atrodilla)
* BitmapText.destroy now checks if it has a canvas before calling parentNode on it.
* Group.swap had a hellish to find bug that only manifested when B-A upward swaps occured. Hours of debugging later = bug crushed.
* Point.rotate asDegrees fixed (thanks BorisKozo)
* ArcadePhysics.separateTile wasn't returning the value, so the custom process callback wasn't getting called (thanks flameiguana)
* StageScaleMode.forceOrientation now correctly stores the forcePortrait value (thanks haden)
* Fixes to Math and Loader (thanks theJare)
* Tween - isRunning not reset when non-looped tween completes (thanks crazysam + kevinthompson)

* The Sprite hulls (used for tile collision) were not being updated in sprite->sprite separations (thanks jcs)
* Plugins that had a postUpdate but no Update weren't being marked as active (thanks crazysam)
* StateManager.onPausedCallback function is not called when the game is paused (thanks haden)
* Fix for 'jitter' in scrolling where tilemaps & sprites are one frame off (thanks jcs)



## Version 1.1.2 - November 1st 2013

* New: You'll now find a complete Basic project Template in the resources/Project Templates folder. Will add more complex ones soon.
* New: Phaser.Button now has the ability to set over/out/up/down sound effects so they play automatically based on those events.
* New: Added init method to plugins, to be called as they are added to the PluginManager (thanks beeglebug)
* New: Physics.Body now has a center property (issue 142, thanks MikeMnD)
* New: Lots of fixes across Full Screen Mode support. Input now works, scaling restores properly, world scale is correct and anti-alias support added.
* New: Added Group.cursor. This points to the first item added to a Group. You can move the cursor with Group.next() and Group.previous().
* New: Added Tween.isTweening(object) to check if an object is currently being tweened or not (thanks mikehamil10)
* New: Added getMagnitude, setMagnitude, normalize and isZero methods to Point (thanks beeglebug)
* New/Change: Group.callAll now supports nested functions and a context, making it really powerful!
* Updated: Fixed a few final bugs in the Sprite body and bounds calculations, in turn this resolved the Tilemap collision issues in the 1.1 release.
* Updated: Finished documentation for the Phaser.Button class.
* Updated: Fixed the Invaders game sample and enhanced it.
* Updated: Fixed the Star Struck game sample and enhanced it.
* Updated: If you pause an Animation, when you next play it it'll resume (un-pause itself).
* Updated: hexToRGB now accepts short hex codes (#EEE) (thanks beeglebug)
* Updated: State functions (preload, update, render, etc) are now passed the current game as a parameter (thanks beeglebug)
* Updated: If your game is running in Canvas (not WebGL) you can now set Stage.backgroundColor to rgba style CSS strings, allowing for semi-transparent game backgrounds.
* Updated: event.preventDefault() has been added to all Mouse event handlers.
* Updated: Sprite.deltaX/Y removed due to non-use. prevX/Y values moved to Sprite._cache.prevX/Y.
* Updated: Due to missing extends parameter the Sprite prototype was picking up functions from classes it never meant to (Button, TilemapLayer), now fully isolated.
* Fixed issue 135 - Added typeof checks into most ArcadePhysics functions to avoid errors with zero values.
* Fixed issue 136 - distanceTo using worldX/Y instead of x/y.
* Fixed lots of examples where the cursor keys / space bar were not locked from moving the browser page (if you find any more, please tell us!)
* Fixed issue 149 - Starling XML files now load properly again, also created an Example to show use of them (thanks haden)
* Fixed an issue where if the Starling XML file didn't contain a frameX/Y value it would crash on import.
* Fixed the Multiple Animations Example - it's now a lovely underwater scene :)
* Fixed issue 141 - If a Sprite is dragged and you release the Pointer while not over the Sprite, it will think it's still over it (thanks Paratron)
* Fixed issue 88 - Incorrect game.input.x/y values on click with scaled stage (thanks DrHackenstein)
* Fixed issue 143 - Entering full screen mode made the Input x/y coordinates go wrong.



## Version 1.1.1 - October 26th 2013

* Quick patch to get Phaser.AUTO working again on Firefox / Android.
* Any key added via addKey now automatically adds it to the capture list.



## Version 1.1 - October 25th 2013

### What's New

* JSDoc is go! We've added jsdoc3 blocks to every property and function, in every file and published the API docs to the docs folder.
* Brand new Example system (no more php!) and over 150 examples to learn from too.
* New TypeScript definitions file generated (in the build folder - thanks to TomTom1229 for manually enhancing this).
* New Grunt based build system added (thanks to Florent Cailhol)
* New: Phaser.Animation.generateFrameNames - really useful when creating animation data from texture atlases using file names, not indexes.
* Added Sprite.play as a handy short-cut to play an animation already loaded onto a Sprite.
* Added Canvas.setUserSelect() to disable touchCallouts and user selections within the canvas.
* Added Keyboard.addKey() which creates a new Phaser.Key object that can be polled for updates, pressed states, etc. See the 2 new examples showing use.
* Added Button.freezeFrames boolean. Stops the frames being set on mouse events if true.
* Extended the Loader 404 error to display the url of the file that didn't load as well as the key.
* New: Direction constants have been added to Sprites and adjust based on body motion.
* Brand new Sprite.update loop handler. Combined with the transform cache fix and further optimisations this is now much quicker to execute.
* Added Keyboard.createCursorKeys() which creates an object with 4 Key objects inside it mapped to up, down, left and right. See the new example in the input folder.
* Added Body.skipQuadTree boolean for more fine-grained control over when a body is added to the World QuadTree.
* Re-implemented Angular Velocity and Angular Acceleration on the Sprite.body and created 2 new examples to show use.
* Added Sprite.fixedToCamera boolean. A Sprite that is fixed to the camera doesn't move with the world, but has its x/y coordinates relative to the top-left of the camera.
* Added Group.createMultiple - useful when you need to create a Group of identical sprites for pooling, such as bullets.
* Added Group.total. Same as Group.length, but more in line with the rest of the Group naming.
* Added Sprite.outOfBoundsKill boolean flag. Will automatically kill a sprite that leaves the game World bounds (off by default).
* Lots of changes and fixes in ArcadePhysics, including:
* Functions with "mouse" in the title have been updated to "pointer" to more accurately reflect what they do.
* New velocity functions: moveToObject, moveToPointer, moveToXY
* New acceleration functions: accelerateToObject, accelerateToPointer, accelerateToXY
* New distance functions: distanceBetween, distanceToXY, distanceToPointer
* New angle functions: angleBetween, angleToXY, angleToPointer
* velocityFromAngle and velocityFromRotation added with examples created.
* Added killOnComplete parameter to Animation.play. Really useful in situations where you want a Sprite to animate once then kill itself on complete, like an explosion effect.
* Added Sprite.loadTexture(key, frame) which allows you to load a new texture set into an existing sprite rather than having to create a new sprite.
* Added Sprite.destroy back in again and made it a lot more robust at cleaning up child objects.
* Added 'return this' to all the core Loader functions so you can chain load calls if you so wish.
* Added Text.destroy() and BitmapText.destroy(), also updated Group.remove to make it more bullet-proof when an element doesn't have any events.
* Added Phaser.Utils.shuffle to shuffle an array.
* Added Graphics.destroy, x, y and updated angle functions.
* Added AnimationManager.refreshFrame - will reset the texture being used for a Sprite (useful after a crop rect clear)
* Added Physics.overlap(sprite1, sprite2) for quick body vs. body overlap tests with no separation performed.
* On a busy page it's possible for the game to boot with an incorrect stage offset x/y which can cause input events to be calculated wrong. A new property has been added to Stage to combat this issue: Stage.checkOffsetInterval. By default it will check the canvas offset every 2500ms and adjust it accordingly. You can set the value to 'false' to disable the check entirely, or set a higher or lower value. We recommend that you get the value quite low during your games preloader, but once the game has fully loaded hopefully the containing page will have settled down, so it's probably safe to disable the check entirely.
* Added Rectangle.floorAll to floor all values in a Rectangle (x, y, width and height).

### What's changed

* Renamed Phaser.Text.text to Phaser.Text.content to avoid conflict and overwrite from Pixi local var.
* Renamed Phaser.Text.style to Phaser.Text.font to avoid conflict and overwrite from Pixi local var.
* Phaser.Button now sets useHandCursor to true by default.
* Change: When you start a new State all active tweens are now purged.
* When the game boots it will now by default disable user-select and touch action events on the game canvas.
* Moved LinkedList.dump to Debug.dumpLinkedList(list)
* Phaser.Animation.Frame is now Phaser.Frame
* Phaser.Animation.FrameData is now Phaser.FrameData
* Phaser.Animation.Parser is now Phaser.AnimationParser (also the file has renamed from Parser.js to AnimationParser.js)
* Phaser.Loader.Parser is now Phaser.LoaderParser (also the file has renamed from Parser.js to LoaderParser.js)
* Change: We've removed the scrollFactor property from all Game Objects. Sorry, but the new Camera system doesn't work with it and it caused all kinds of issues anyway. We will sort out a replacement for it at a later date.
* Change: World now extends Phaser.Group. As a result we've updated GameObjectFactory and other classes that linked to it. If you have anywhere in your code that used to reference world.group you can just remove 'group' from that. So before, world.group.add() is now just world.add().
* Change: The Camera has been completely revamped. Rather than adjusting the position of all display objects (bad) it now just shifts the position of the single world container (good!), this is much quicker and also stops the game objects positions from self-adjusting all the time, allowing for them to be properly nested with other containers.
* Made Sprite.body optional and added in checks, so you can safely null the Sprite body object if using your own physics system and not impact rendering.
* Moved the Camera update checks to World.postUpdate, so all the sprites get the correct adjusted camera position.
* The default Game.antialias value is now 'true', so graphics will be smoothed automatically in canvas. Disable it via the Game constructor or Canvas utils.
* Phaser.Group now automatically calls updateTransform on any child added to it (avoids temp. frame glitches when new objects are rendered on their first frame).

### What has been updated:

* Complete overhaul of Physics.Arcade.Body - now significantly more stable and faster too.
* Updated ArcadePhysics.separateX/Y to use new body system - much better results now.
* Added World.postUpdate - all sprite position changes, as a result of physics, happen here before the render.
* Added Animation.paused - can be set to true/false.
* Added support for Body.maxVelocity (thanks cocoademon)
* InputHandler now creates the _pointerData array on creation and populates with one empty set of values, so pointerOver etc all work before a start call.
* Removed the callbackContext parameter from Group.callAll because it's no longer needed.
* Updated Group.forEach, forEachAlive and forEachDead so you can now pass as many parameters as you want, which will all be given to the callback after the child.
* Updated build script so it can be run from the command-line and includes UMD wrappers (thanks iaincarsberg)
* World.randomX/Y now returns values anywhere in the world.bounds range (if set, otherwise 0), including negative values.
* Updated InputHandler to use Math.round rather than Math.floor when snapping an object during drag.
* If you didn't provide the useNumericIndex parameter then AnimationManager.add will set the value by looking at the datatype of the first element in the frames array.
* Group.create now sets the visible and alive properties of the Sprite to the same value as the 'exists' parameter.
* World.randomX/Y now works with negative World.bounds values.
* Tweens .to will now always return the parent (thanks powerfear)
* You can now pass a PIXI.Texture to Sprite (you also need to pass a Phaser.Frame as the frame parameter) but this is useful for Sprites sharing joint canvases.
* Group.alpha is now exposed publically and changes the Group container object (not the children directly, who can still have their own alpha values)
* Device.webGL uses new inspection code to accurately catch more webGL capable devices.
* Debug.renderSpriteBody updated to use a the new Sprite.Body.screenX/Y properties.
* Additional checks added to AnimationManager.frame/frameName on the given values.
* You can now null a Sprite.crop and it will clear down the crop rect area correctly.
* Phaser.Time physicsElapsed delta timer clamp added. Stops rogue iOS / slow mobile timer errors causing crazy high deltas.
* Animation.generateFrameNames can now work in reverse, so the start/stop values can create frames that increment or decrement respectively.
* Loader updated to use xhr.responseText when loading json, csv or text files. xhr.response is still used for Web Audio binary files (thanks bubba)
* Input.onDown and onUp events now dispatch the original event that triggered them (i.e. a MouseEvent or TouchEvent) as the 2nd parameter, after the Pointer (thanks rezoner)
* Updated Sprite.crop significantly. Values are now cached, stopping constant Texture frame updates and you can do sprite.crop.width++ for example (thanks haden)
* Change: Sprite.crop needs to be enabled with sprite.cropEnabled = true.
* Sprite.loadTexture now works correctly with static images, RenderTextures and Animations.
* Lots of fixes within Sprite.bounds. The bounds is now correct regardless of rotation, anchor or scale of the Sprite or any of its parent objects.

### What has been fixed:

* QuadTree bug found in 1.0.5 now fixed. The QuadTree is updated properly now using localTransform values.
* Fixed the Bounce.In and Bounce.InOut tweens (thanks XekeDeath)
* Fixed an issue in Animation.update where if the game was paused it would get an insane delta timer throwing a uuid error.
* Added PixiPatch.js to patch in a few essential features until Pixi is updated.
* Fixed issue in Animation.play where the given frameRate and loop values wouldn't overwrite those set on construction.
* Fixed small bug stopping Tween.pause / resume from resuming correctly when called directly.
* Fixed an issue where Tweens.removeAll wasn't clearing tweens in the addition queue.
* Fixed Particle Emitters when using Emitter width/height (thanks XekeDeath)
* Made animation looping more robust when skipping frames (thanks XekeDeath)
* Fix for incorrect new particle positioning (issue #73) (thanks cottonflop)
* Fixed issue in Sound.play where if you gave a missing marker it would play the whole sound sprite instead.
* Button.setFrames will set the current frame based on the button state immediately.
* Loaded.setPreloadSprite now rounds the width/height values and starts from 1. This fixes canvas draw errors in IE9/10 and Firefox.
* Fixed issue causing Keyboard.justPressed to always fire (thanks stemkoski)
* Fixed bug in LinkedList#remove that could cause first to point to a dead node (thanks onedayitwillmake)
* Fixed Cache.addDefaultImage so the default image works in Canvas as well as WebGL. Updated to a new image (32x32 black square with green outline)
* Fixed a bug in the Sprite transform cache check that caused the skew/scale cache to get constantly invalidated - now only updates as needed, significant performance increase!

* Fixed issue in Group.countLiving / countDead where the value was off by one (thanks mjablonski)
* Fixed issue with a jittery Camera if you moved a Sprite via velocity instead of x/y placement.

* Game.destroy will now stop the raf from running as well as close down all input related event listeners (issue 92, thanks astrism)
* Pixel Perfect click detection now works even if the Sprite is part of a texture atlas.



## Version 1.0.6 - September 24th 2013

* Added check into Pointer.move to always consider a Sprite that has pixelPerfect enabled, regardless of render ID.
* BUG: The pixel perfect click check doesn't work if the sprite is part of a texture atlas yet.
* Fixed issue with anti-alias in the Game constructor not being set correctly (thanks luizbills)
* Added support for the Graphics game object back in and two examples (thanks earok for spotting)
* New: Tweens can now be chained via multiple to() calls + example created (thanks to powerfear for adding)
* Fixed Math.wrap (thanks TheJare)
* New: When loading a Sprite Sheet you can now pass negative values for the frame sizes which specifies the number of rows/columns to load instead (thanks TheJare)

* Added in extra checks to halt collision if it involves an empty Group (thanks cang)
* Added time smoothing to Animation update to help frames hopefully not get too out of sync during long animations with high frame rates.
* Added frame skip to Animation.update. If it gets too far behind it will now skip frames to try and catch up.



## Version 1.0.5 - September 20th 2013

* Fixed issue in FrameData.getFrameIndexes where the input array was being ignored.
* Added Math.numberArray - Returns an Array containing the numbers from min to max (inclusive), useful for animation frame construction.
* Fixed a horrendously sneaky bug: If a new tween was created in the onComplete callback of a tween about to be deleted, it would get automatically spliced.
* Added a pendingDelete property to Tween to stop tweens that were removed during a callback from causing update errors during the TweenManager loop.
* Added Group.length property.
* Added explicit x/y attributes to Phaser.Text to make it work with the camera system (thanks cocoademon).
* Fixed issue stopping multiple animations from playing, only the most recent would play (frames array was being overwritten, thanks Legrandk)
* Updated Debug.renderSpriteBounds() so it doesn't use the deprecated Sprite.worldView any more (thanks MikeMnD)
* Added 2 new properties to the Text object: Text.text and Text.style, both are getter/setters and don't flag dirty unless changed, so safe for core loop use.
* Removed the exists check from Group.callAll, it now runs on all children (as the name implies)
* Added Group.callAllExists - you can now call a function on all children who have exists = the provided boolean.
* Finished off the Breakout example game - now fully playable, proper rebound, scoring, lives, etc.
* Removed Group.sort dummy entry until it's working.
* Removed ArcadePhysics.postUpdate.
* Updated Sprite.update to set renderable to false when the object goes out of Camera, not 'visible' false, otherwise it stops the transform being updated by Pixi.
* BUG: There is a known issue where the wrong rect coordinates are given to the QuadTree if the Sprite is a child of a Group or another Sprite which has an x/y offset.



## Version 1.0.4 - September 18th 2013

* Small fix to Phaser.Canvas to stop it from setting overflow hidden if the parent DOM element doesn't exist.
* Added Loader.setPreloadSprite(sprite, direction) - this will automatically apply a crop rect to the Sprite which is updated in line with the load progress.
* A lot of changes inside the StateManager. State functions are now passed through link() which automatically creates the key Game properties (load, input, etc)
* Fixed a bug in getFrameByName that wouldn't return the first frame in the array.
* Updated Phaser.Rectangle.intersects to use x and y instead of left and top so it can be used to check Physics bodies overlapping.
* Fixed issue in Cache where the Frame index wasn't being set correctly (thanks Cameron)
* Fixed issue in Sprite where boundsY wasn't set (thanks Cameron)
* For some reason there were 2 copies of the Canvas class in the build file - fixed, a few KB saved :)

* FrameData.getFrameIndexes and getFrameIndexesByName refactored into a more versatile getFrames function.
* Various fixes to looping parameters in the Sound system.
* Documentation started across most classes. Keep track of progress in the Docs folder.
* Optimised AnimationManager.add so it will only get the required frames rather than all of them and is now faster at parsing the frame data.
* Fixed Phaser.Text and Phaser.BitmapText so they now render correctly and added several Text examples.



## Version 1.0.2 - September 16th 2013

* Added optional parameter to Animation.stop: resetFrame. If true the animation will be stopped and then the current frame reset to the first frame in the animation.
* Fixed an issue causing 'explode' particle bursts to ignore the quantity parameter.
* Added 'collideWorldBounds' to Emitter.makeParticles function.
* Added Emitter.angularDrag
* Changed Emitter.bounce from a number to a Point, so now set its x/y properties to control different amounts of bounce per axis.

* Heavily optimised Group so it no longer creates any temporary variables in any methods.
* Added Game.renderer which can be HEADLESS, CANVAS or WEBGL (coming soon)
* Added Sprite.render which is a reference to IRenderer.renderSprite, but can be overridden for custom handling.

* Added 2 new State functions: loadRender and loadUpdate, are called the same as render and update but only during the load process
* Fixed Input.stopDrag so it fires an onInputUp event as well from the sprite.
* Added support for a preRender state - very useful for certain types of special effects.
* Cameras are now limited so they can never be larger than the Game.Stage size.
* Added a new Button Game Object for easily creating in-game UI and menu systems.
* Fixed bug where Sprite.alpha wasn't properly reflecting Sprite.texture.alpha.
* Fixed bug where the hand cursor would be reset on input up, even if the mouse was still over the sprite.
* Fixed bug where pressing down then moving out of the sprite area wouldn't properly reset the input state next time you moved over the sprite.

* Added Sprite.transform.centerOn(x,y) to quickly center a sprite on a coordinate without messing with the sprite origin and regardless of rotation.
* Added Input.pollRate - this lets you limit how often Pointer events are handled (0 = every frame, 1 = every other frame, etc)
* Renamed the 'init' function to 'preload'. It now calls load.start automatically.
* Added CanvasUtils class, including ability to set image rendering, add a canvas to the dom and other handy things.

* Added DynamicTexture.assignCanvasToGameObjects() to allow you to redirect GameObject rendering en-mass to a DynamicTexture
* Added DynamicTexture.render(x,y) to render the texture to the Stage canvas
* Added Basic.ignoreGlobalUpdate - stops the object being updated as part of the main game loop, you'll need to call update on it yourself
* Added Basic.ignoreGlobalRender - stops the object being rendered as part of the main game loop, you'll need to call render on it yourself
* Added forceUpdate and forceRender parameters to Group.update and Group.render respectively. Combined with ignoreGlobal you can create custom rendering set-ups
* Fixed Loader.progress calculation so it now accurately passes a value between 0 and 100 to your loader callback
* Added a 'hard reset' parameter to Input.reset. A hard reset clears Input signals (such as on a state swap), a soft (such as on game pause) doesn't
* Added Device.isConsoleOpen() to check if the browser console is open. Tested on Firefox with Firebug and Chrome with DevTools
* Added delay parameter to Tween.to()

* Added the clearAnimations parameter to Sprite.loadGraphic(). Allows you to change animation textures but retain the frame data.
* Added the GameObjectFactory to Game. You now make Sprites like this: game.add.sprite(). Much better separation of game object creation methods now. But you'll have to update ALL code, sorry! (blame JesseFreeman for breaking your code and coming up with the idea :)

## Version 0.9.5

* Moved the BootScreen and PauseScreen out of Stage into their own classes (system/screens/BootScreen and PauseScreen).
* Updated the PauseScreen to show a subtle animation effect, making it easier to create your own interesting pause screens.
* Modified Game so it splits into 3 loops - bootLoop, pauseLoop and loop (the core loop).
* Updated the BootScreen with the new logo and new color cycle effect.
* Added Game.isRunning - set to true once the Game.boot process is over IF you gave some functions to the constructor or a state.
* Fixed small bug in Signal.removeAll where it could try to shorten the _bindings even if undefined.
* Added the new FXManager which is used for handling all special effects on Cameras (and soon other game objects).
* Removed Flash, Fade and Shake from the Camera class and moved to the new SpecialFX project.
* SpecialFX compiles to phaser-fx.js in the build folder, which is copied over to Tests. If you don't need the FX, don't include the .js file.
* The project is now generating TypeScript declaration files and all Tests were updated to use them in their references.
* Fixed a bug in Flash, Fade and Shake where the duration would fail on anything above 3 seconds.
* Fixed a bug in Camera Shake that made it go a bit haywire, now shakes correctly.
* Added new Scanlines Camera FX.
* Fixed offset values being ignored in GeomSprite.renderPoint (thanks bapuna).
* Added new Mirror Camera FX. Can mirror the camera image horizontally, vertically or both with an optional fill color overlay.
* Added Camera.disableClipping for when you don't care about things being drawn outside the edge (useful for some FX).
* Updated TilemapLayer so that collision data is now stored in _tempTileBlock to avoid constant array creation during game loop.
* TilemapLayer.getTileOverlaps() now returns all tiles the object overlapped with rather than just a boolean.
* Tilemap.collide now optionally takes callback and context parameters which are used if collision occurs.
* Added Tilemap.collisionCallback and Tilemap.collisionCallbackContext so you can set them once and not re-set them on every call to collide.
* Collision.separateTile now has 2 extra parameters: separateX and separateY. If true the object will be separated on overlap, otherwise just the overlap boolean result is returned.
* Added Tile.separateX and Tile.separateY (both true by default). Set to false if you don't want a tile to stop an object from moving, you just want it to return collision data to your callback.
* Added Tilemap.getTileByIndex(value) to access a specific type of tile, rather than by its map index.
* Added TilemapLayer.putTile(x,y,index) - allows you to insert new tile data into the map layer (create your own tile editor!).
* TilemapLayer.getTileBlock now returns a unique Array of map data, not just a reference to the temporary block array
* Added TilemapLayer.swapTile - scans the given region of the map for all instances of tileA and swaps them for tileB, and vice versa.
* Added TilemapLayer.replaceTile - scans the given region of the map and replaces all instances of tileA with tileB. tileB is left unaffected.
* Added TilemapLayer.fillTiles - fills the given region of the map with the tile specified.
* Added TilemapLayer.randomiseTiles - fills the given region of the map with a random tile from the list specified.
* Added fun new "map draw" test - rebound those carrots! :)
* Changed SoundManager class to respect volume on first play (thanks initials and hackmaniac)



## Version 0.9.4

* Added Tilemap.getTile, getTileFromWorldXY, getTileFromInputXY
* Added Tilemap.setCollisionByIndex and setCollisionByRange
* Added GameObject.renderRotation boolean to control if the sprite will visually rotate or not (useful when angle needs to change but graphics don't)
* Added additional check to Camera.width/height so you cannot set them larger than the Stage size
* Added Collision.separateTile and Tilemap.collide
* Fixed Tilemap bounds check if map was smaller than game dimensions
* Fixed: Made World._cameras public, World.cameras and turned Game.camera into a getter for it (thanks Hackmaniac)

* Updated Gruntfile to export new version of phaser.js wrapped in a UMD block for require.js/commonJS (thanks Hackmaniac)



## Version 0.9.3

* Added the new ScrollZone game object. Endlessly useful but especially for scrolling backdrops. Created 6 example tests.
* Added GameObject.hideFromCamera(cameraID) to stop an object rendering to specific cameras (also showToCamera and clearCameraList)
* Added GameObject.setBounds() to confine a game object to a specific area within the world (useful for stopping them going off the edges)
* Added GameObject.outOfBoundsAction, can be either OUT OF BOUNDS STOP which stops the object moving, or OUT OF BOUNDS KILL which kills it.
* Added GameObject.rotationOffset. Useful if your graphics need to rotate but weren't drawn facing zero degrees (to the right).
* Added shiftSinTable and shiftCosTable to the GameMath class to allow for quick iteration through the data tables.
* Added more robust frame checking into AnimationManager
* Re-built Tilemap handling from scratch to allow for proper layered maps (as exported from Tiled / Mappy)
* Tilemap no longer requires a buffer per Camera (in prep for WebGL support)
* Fixed issues with Group not adding reference to Game to newly created objects (thanks JesseFreeman)
* Fixed a potential race condition issue in Game.boot (thanks Hackmaniac)
* Fixed issue with showing frame zero of a texture atlas before the animation started playing (thanks JesseFreeman)
* Fixed a bug where Camera.visible = false would still render
* Removed the need for DynamicTextures to require a key property and updated test cases.
* You can now pass an array or a single value to Input.Keyboard.addKeyCapture().



## Version 0.9.2

* Fixed issue with create not being called if there was an empty init method.
* Added ability to flip a sprite (Sprite.flipped = true) + a test case for it.
* Added ability to restart a sprite animation.
* Sprite animations don't restart if you call play on them when they are already running.
* Added Stage.disablePauseScreen. Set to true to stop your game pausing when the tab loses focus.



## Version 0.9.1

* Added the new align property to GameObjects that controls placement when rendering.
* Added an align example to the Sprites test group (click the mouse to change alignment position)
* Added a new MicroPoint class. Same as Point but much smaller / less functions, updated GameObject to use it.
* Completely rebuilt the Rectangle class to use MicroPoints and store the values of the 9 points around the edges, to be used
for new collision system.
* Game.Input now has 2 signals you can subscribe to for down/up events, see the Sprite align example for use.
* Updated the States examples to bring in-line with 0.9 release.



## Version 0.9

* Large refactoring. Everything now lives inside the Phaser module, so all code and all tests have been updated to reflect this. Makes coding a tiny bit more verbose but stops the framework from globbing up the global namespace. Also should make code-insight work in WebStorm and similar editors.
* Added the new GeomSprite object. This is a sprite that uses a geometry class for display (Circle, Rectangle, Point, Line). It's extremely flexible!
* Added Geometry intersection results objects.
* Added new Collision class and moved some functions there. Contains all the Game Object and Geometry Intersection methods.
* Can now create a sprite animation based on frame names rather than indexes. Useful when you've an animation inside a texture atlas. Added test to show.
* Added addKeyCapture(), removeKeyCapture() and clearCaptures() to Input.Keyboard. Calls event.preventDefault() on any keycode set to capture, allowing you to avoid page scrolling when using the cursor keys in a game for example.
* Added new Motion class which contains lots of handy functions like 'moveTowardsObject', 'velocityFromAngle' and more.
* Tween Manager added. You can now create tweens via Game.createTween (or for more control game.tweens). All the usual suspects are here: Bounce, * Elastic, Quintic, etc and it's hooked into the core game clock, so if your game pauses and resumes your tweens adjust accordingly.



## Version 0.8

* Added ability to set Sprite frame by name (sprite.frameName), useful when you've loaded a Texture Atlas with filename values set rather than using frame indexes.
* Updated texture atlas 4 demo to show this.
* Fixed a bug that would cause a run-time error if you tried to create a sprite using an invalid texture key.
* Added in DynamicTexture support and a test case for it.



## Version 0.7

* Renamed FullScreen to StageScaleMode as it's much more fitting. Tested across Android and iOS with the various scale modes.
* Added in world x/y coordinates to the input class, and the ability to get world x/y input coordinates from any Camera.
* Added the RandomDataGenerator for seeded random number generation.
* Setting the game world size now resizes the default camera (optional bool flag)



## Version 0.6

* Added in Touch support for mobile devices (and desktops that enable it) and populated x/y coords in Input with common values from touch and mouse.
* Added new Circle geometry class (used by Touch) and moved them into a Geom folder.
* Added in Device class for device inspection.
* Added FullScreen class to enable full-screen support on mobile devices (scrolls URL bar out of the way on iOS and Android)



## Version 0.5

* Initial release
