        <h1>Getting started with Phaser</h1>

        <h2>Part 6 - Hello World!</h2>

        <p>With your editor set-up, web server installed and Phaser downloaded it's time to create something and check it's all working.</p>

        <p>You need to discover where your 'web root' is on your machine. This is the folder in which the server looks for files. If you are using WAMP on Windows you can locate it by clicking the WAMP icon in your system-tray and select "www directory" from the pop-up menu. Other servers will have other methods of determining the location, but from this point on we'll refer to it as the 'webroot'.</p>

        <p>Download <a href="hellophaser.zip">this zip file</a>. It contains a folder called 'hellophaser' inside which you'll find a JavaScript file, an index.html and a PNG. Copy the 'hellophaser' folder to your webroot.</p>

        <h3>Testing, testing ...</h3>

        <p>Open your web browser and browse to your local server. This may be as simple as typing in 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' or you may need to specify a port number as well, it depends entirely on which server set-up method you used. If the server is set-up correctly and running you will see the default installation page in your browser. This will vary from server to server, but as long as the page doesn't "time out" or throw a permissions error you are good to go.</p>

        <p>Now add <em>/hellophaser</em> onto the end of the URL and the Hello World test should load. If it does it will display a black game area with a phaser logo in the middle. If it doesn't for whatever reason you need to bring up the debug console and see what errors are output. In most browsers you can do this by pressing F12. This works across Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. Check to see what the error is, hopefully it's a simple one like the files being missing, in which case check your folder names and refresh the page. If it's something more complex feel free to post about it <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/14-phaser/">on the forum</a> and we'll help.</p>
