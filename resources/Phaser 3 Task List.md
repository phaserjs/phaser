Phaser 3 TODO
=============

* Make Container use the Children component
* Swap Stage and World so they're just Containers (not Groups)
* Look at having `alpha` and similar properties (blend and scale modes?) as getters, so we can store the dirty state of a Game Object, and then not re-render the entire Canvas if nothing has changed.
*
