Change Log
----------

Version 1.0.6 (September 24th 2013)

* Added check into Pointer.move to always consider a Sprite that has pixelPerfect enabled, regardless of render ID.
* BUG: The pixel perfect click check doesn't work if the sprite is part of a texture atlas yet.
* Fixed issue with anti-alias in the Game constructor not being set correctly (thanks luizbills)
* Added support for the Graphics game object back in and two examples (thanks earok for spotting)
* New: Tweens can now be chained via multiple to() calls + example created (thanks to powerfear for adding)
* Fixed Math.wrap (thanks TheJare)
* New: When loading a Sprite Sheet you can now pass negative values for the frame sizes which specifies the number of rows/columns to load instead (thanks TheJare)
* New: BitmapText now supports anchor and has fixed box dimensions (thanks TheJare)
* Fixed bug where if a State contains an empty Preloader the Update will not be called (thanks TheJare)
* Several new examples added (cameras, tweens, etc)
* Added in extra checks to halt collision if it involves an empty Group (thanks cang)
* Added time smoothing to Animation update to help frames hopefully not get too out of sync during long animations with high frame rates.
* Added frame skip to Animation.update. If it gets too far behind it will now skip frames to try and catch up.

Version 1.0.5 (September 20th 2013)

* Fixed issue in FrameData.getFrameIndexes where the input array was being ignored.
* Added Math.numberArray - Returns an Array containing the numbers from min to max (inclusive), useful for animation frame construction.
* Fixed a horrendously sneaky bug: If a new tween was created in the onComplete callback of a tween about to be deleted, it would get automatically spliced.
* Added a pendingDelete property to Tween to stop tweens that were removed during a callback from causing update errors during the TweenManager loop.
* Added Group.length property.
* Added explicit x/y attributes to Phaser.Text to make it work with the camera system (thanks cocoademon).
* Fixed issue stopping multiple animations from playing, only the most recent would play (frames array was being overwritten, thanks Legrandk)
* Updated Debug.renderSpriteBounds() so it doesn't use the deprecated Sprite.worldView any more (thanks MikeMnD)
* Added 2 new properties to the Text object: Text.text and Text.style, both are getter/setters and don't flag dirty unless changed, so safe for core loop use.
* Removed the exists check from Group.callAll, it now runs on all children (as the name implies)
* Added Group.callAllExists - you can now call a function on all children who have exists = the provided boolean.
* Finished off the Breakout example game - now fully playable, proper rebound, scoring, lives, etc.
* Removed Group.sort dummy entry until it's working.
* Removed ArcadePhysics.postUpdate.
* Updated Sprite.update to set renderable to false when the object goes out of Camera, not 'visible' false, otherwise it stops the transform being updated by Pixi.
* BUG: There is a known issue where the wrong rect coordinates are given to the QuadTree if the Sprite is a child of a Group or another Sprite which has an x/y offset.

Version 1.0.4 (September 18th 2013)

* Small fix to Phaser.Canvas to stop it from setting overflow hidden if the parent DOM element doesn't exist.
* Added Loader.setPreloadSprite(sprite, direction) - this will automatically apply a crop rect to the Sprite which is updated in line with the load progress.
* A lot of changes inside the StateManager. State functions are now passed through link() which automatically creates the key Game properties (load, input, etc)
* Fixed a bug in getFrameByName that wouldn't return the first frame in the array.
* Updated Phaser.Rectangle.intersects to use x and y instead of left and top so it can be used to check Physics bodies overlapping.
* Fixed issue in Cache where the Frame index wasn't being set correctly (thanks Cameron)
* Fixed issue in Sprite where boundsY wasn't set (thanks Cameron)
* For some reason there were 2 copies of the Canvas class in the build file - fixed, a few KB saved :)

Version 1.0.3 (September 17th 2013)

* FrameData.getFrameIndexes and getFrameIndexesByName refactored into a more versatile getFrames function.
* Various fixes to looping parameters in the Sound system.
* Documentation started across most classes. Keep track of progress in the Docs folder.
* Optimised AnimationManager.add so it will only get the required frames rather than all of them and is now faster at parsing the frame data.
* Fixed Phaser.Text and Phaser.BitmapText so they now render correctly and added several Text examples.

Version 1.0.2 (September 16th 2013)

* Added optional parameter to Animation.stop: resetFrame. If true the animation will be stopped and then the current frame reset to the first frame in the animation.
* Fixed an issue causing 'explode' particle bursts to ignore the quantity parameter.
* Added 'collideWorldBounds' to Emitter.makeParticles function.
* Added Emitter.angularDrag
* Changed Emitter.bounce from a number to a Point, so now set its x/y properties to control different amounts of bounce per axis.
* Fixed a bug in the AnimationManager where useNumericIndex was always set to true
* Added in lots of Particle examples
* Added in the start of a Breakout game
* Added in the start of a Platformer game

Version 1.0.1 (September 15th 2013)

* Added checks into every Group function to ensure that the Group has children before running them.
* Added optional flag to Group.create which allows you to set the default exists state of the Sprites.
* Sprite.animation.stop no longer needs an animation name parameter, will default to stopping the current animation.
* Fixed the license in package.json
* Fixed a logic bug in the separateTileX function that would sometimes cause tunneling of big sprites through small tiles.

Version 0.9.8

* Massive refactoring across the entire codebase.
* Removed Basic and GameObject and put Sprite on a diet. 127 properties and methods cut down to 32.
* Added a new headless renderer for non-display related performance testing.
* Added camera type to the CameraManager for future non-orthographic cameras.
* Added Camera.destroy - now clears down the FX and unregisters itself from the CameraManager.
* Added Camera.hide/show to hide Sprites or Groups from rendering (and removed corresponding hideFromCamera methods from Sprites/Groups)
* Heavily optimised Group so it no longer creates any temporary variables in any methods.
* Added Game.renderer which can be HEADLESS, CANVAS or WEBGL (coming soon)
* Added Sprite.render which is a reference to IRenderer.renderSprite, but can be overridden for custom handling.
* Refactored QuadTree so it no longer creates any temporary variables in any methods.
* The Sprite Renderer now uses a single setTransform for scale, rotation and translation that respects the Sprite.origin value in all cases.
* Sprite.modified is set to true if scale, rotation, skew or flip have been used.
* Added Tween.loop property so they can now re-run themselves indefinitely.
* Added Tween.yoyo property so they can reverse themselves after completing.
* Added Gravity to the Physics component.
* Removed Sprite.angle - use Sprite.rotation instead
* Optimised separateX/Y and overlap so they don't use any temporary vars any more.
* Added the new Physics.Body object to all Sprites. Used for all physics calculations in-game. Will be extended for Fixtures/Joints in future.

* Added Sprite.Input.useHandCursor (for desktop)
* Added Sprite.Input.justOver and justOut with a configurable ms delay

* Added Group.addNewSprite(x,y,key) for quick addition of new Sprites to a Group
* Fixed Group.sort so the sortHandler is called correctly

* Added Input drag, bounds, sprite bounds and snapping support.
* Added the new ColorUtils class full of lots of handy color manipulation functions.
* Fixed issue in Camera.inCamera check where it wouldn't take into consideration the Sprites scrollFactor.
* Fixed issue with JSON Atlas loader incorrectly parsing the frames array.
* Fixed bug in FrameData.getFrameByName where the first frame of the array would always be skipped.
* Fixed bug where the Stage.backgroundColor property wasn't being saved correctly.

* Added the new OrientationScreen and Stage.enableOrientationCheck to allow for easy 'portrait/landscape only' game handling.
* Added fix to StageScaleMode for 180 degree portrait orientation on iPad.
* Added fix to orientation check so that it updates the input offsets correctly on rotation.
* Added support for minWidth and minHeight to game scale size, so it can never go below those values when scaling.
* Vastly improved orientation detection and response speed.
* Added custom callback support for all Touch and Mouse Events so you can easily hook events to custom APIs.
* Updated Game.loader and its methods. You now load images by: game.load.image() and also: game.load.atlas, game.load.audio, game.load.spritesheet, game.load.text. And you start it with game.load.start().
* Added optional frame parameter to Phaser.Sprite (and game.add.sprite) so you can set a frame ID or frame name on construction.
* Fixed bug where passing a texture atlas string would incorrectly skip the frames array.
* Added AnimationManager.autoUpdateBounds to control if a new frame should change the physics bounds of a sprite body or not.
* Added StageScaleMode.pageAlignHorizontally and pageAlignVertically booleans. When true Phaser will set the margin-left and top of the canvas element so that it is positioned in the middle of the page (based only on window.innerWidth).

* Added ability for a Camera to skew and rotate around an origin.
* Moved the Camera rendering into CanvasRenderer to keep things consistent.
* Added Stage.setImageRenderingCrisp to quickly set the canvas image-rendering to crisp-edges (note: poor browser support atm)
* Sprite.width / height now report the scaled width height, setting them adjusts the scale as it does so.
* Created a Transform component containing scale, skew, rotation, scrollFactor, origin and rotationOffset. Added to Sprite, Camera, Group.
* Created a Texture component containing image data, alpha, flippedX, flippedY, etc. Added to Sprite, Camera, Group.
* Added CameraManager.swap and CameraManager.sort methods and added a z-index property to Camera to control render order.
* Added World.postUpdate loop + Group and Camera postUpdate methods.
* Fixed issue stopping Pointer from working in world coordinates and fixed the world drag example.

* Added input.activePointer which contains a reference to the most recently active pointer.
* Sprite.Transform now has upperLeft, upperRight, bottomLeft and bottomRight Point properties and lots of useful coordinate related methods.
* Camera.inCamera check now uses the Sprite.worldView which finally accurately updates regardless of scale, rotation or rotation origin.
* Added Math.Mat3 for Matrix3 operations (which Sprite.Transform uses) and Math.Mat3Utils for lots of use Mat3 related methods.
* Added SpriteUtils.overlapsXY and overlapsPoint to check if a point is within a sprite, taking scale and rotation into account.
* Added Cache.getImageKeys (and similar) to return an array of all the keys for all currently cached objects.
* Added Group.bringToTop feature. Will sort the Group, move the given sprites z-index to the top and shift the rest down by one.

* Fixed issue in Tilemap.parseTiledJSON where it would accidentally think image and object layers were map data.
* Fixed bug in Group.bringToTop if the child didn't have a group property yet.
* Fixed bug in FrameData.checkFrameName where the first index of the _frameNames array would be skipped.
* Added isRunning boolean property to Phaser.Tween
* Moved 'facing' property from Sprite.body to Sprite.texture (may move to Sprite core)
* Added Sprite.events.onDragStart and onDragStop
* A tilemap can now be loaded without a tile sheet, should you just want to get the tile data from it and not render.
* Added new Sprite.events: onAnimationStart, onAnimationComplete, onAnimationLoop
* Added in support for the Input component PriorityID value and refactored Input.Pointer to respect it. Rollovers are perfect now :)
* Added 2 new State functions: loadRender and loadUpdate, are called the same as render and update but only during the load process
* Fixed Input.stopDrag so it fires an onInputUp event as well from the sprite.
* Added support for a preRender state - very useful for certain types of special effects.
* Cameras are now limited so they can never be larger than the Game.Stage size.
* Added a new Button Game Object for easily creating in-game UI and menu systems.
* Fixed bug where Sprite.alpha wasn't properly reflecting Sprite.texture.alpha.
* Fixed bug where the hand cursor would be reset on input up, even if the mouse was still over the sprite.
* Fixed bug where pressing down then moving out of the sprite area wouldn't properly reset the input state next time you moved over the sprite.
* Added the Sprite.tween property, really useful to avoid creating new tween vars in your local scope if you don't need them.
* Added support for pagehide and pageshow events to Stage, hooked in to the pause/resume game methods.
* Extended Device audio checks to include opus and webm.
* Updated Loader and Cache so they now support loading of Audio() tags as well as Web Audio.
* Set Input.recordPointerHistory to false, you now need to enable the pointer tracking if you wish to use it.
* SoundManager will now automatically handle iOS touch unlocking.
* Added TilemapLayer.putTileWorldXY to place a tile based on pixel values, and putTile based on tile map coordinates.
* Dropped the StageScaleMode.setScreenSize iterations count from 40 down to 10 and document min body height to 2000px.
* Added Phaser.Net for browser and network specific functions, currently includes query string parsing and updating methods.
* Added a new CSS3 Filters component. Apply blur, grayscale, sepia, brightness, contrast, hue rotation, invert, opacity and saturate filters to the games stage.
* Fixed the CircleUtils.contains and containsPoint methods.
* Fixed issue with Input.speed values being too high on new touch events.
* Added Sprite.bringToTop()
* Added Stage.disableVisibilityChange to stop the auto pause/resume from ever firing.
* Added crop support to the Texture component, so you can do Sprite.crop to restrict rendering to a specified Rectangle without distortion.
* Added references to all the event listener functions so they can be cleanly destroyed.
* Fixed interesting Firefox issue when an audio track ended it fired another 'canplaythrough' event, confusing the Loader.
* Added the new PluginManager. Moved all the Camera FX over to plugins. Everything will be a plugin from now on.
* Added Sprite.transform.centerOn(x,y) to quickly center a sprite on a coordinate without messing with the sprite origin and regardless of rotation.
* Added Input.pollRate - this lets you limit how often Pointer events are handled (0 = every frame, 1 = every other frame, etc)
* Renamed the 'init' function to 'preload'. It now calls load.start automatically.
* Added CanvasUtils class, including ability to set image rendering, add a canvas to the dom and other handy things.


Version 0.9.6

* Updated RequestAnimationFrame to use performance.now for sub-millisecond precision and to drive the Game.time.update loop.
* Updated RequestAnimationFrame setTimeout to use fixed timestep and re-ordered callback sequence. Android 2/iOS5 performance much better now.
* Removed Stage.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE statics because the values should be taken from Stage.scale.isPortrait / isLandscape.
* Removed Stage.maxScaleX/Y and moved them into StageScaleMode.minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth and maxHeight.
* Fixed Stage.scale so that it resizes without needing an orientation change first.
* Added StageScaleMode.startFullscreen(), stopFullScreen() and isFullScreen for making use of the FullScreen API on desktop browsers.
* Swapped Stage.offset from Point to MicroPoint.
* Swapped Stage.bounds from Rectangle to Quad.
* Added State.destroy support. A states destroy function is called when you switch to a new state (thanks JesseFreeman).
* Added Sprite.fillColor, used in the Sprite render if no image is loaded (set via the property or Sprite.makeGraphic) (thanks JesseFreeman).
* Renamed Phaser.Finger to Phaser.Pointer.
* Updated all of the Input classes so they now use Input.pointers 1 through 10.
* Updated Touch and MSPointer to allow multi-touch support (when the hardware supports it) and created new tests to show this.
* Added Input.getPointer, Input.getPointerFromIdentifier, Input.totalActivePointers and Input.totalInactivePointers.
* Added Input.startPointer, Input.updatePointer and Input.stopPointer.
* Phaser Input now confirmed working on Windows Phone 8 (Nokia Lumia 920).
* Added Input.maxPointers to allow you to limit the number of fingers your game will listen for on multi-touch systems.
* Added Input.addPointer. By default Input will create 5 pointers (+1 for the mouse). Use addPointer() to add up to a maximum of 10.
* Added Input.position - a Vector2 object containing the most recent position of the most recently active Pointer.
* Added Input.getDistance. Find the distance between the two given Pointer objects.
* Added Input.getAngle. Find the angle between the two given Pointer objects.
* Pointer.totalTouches value keeps a running total of the number of times the Pointer has been pressed.
* Added Pointer.position and positionDown. positionDown is placed on touch and position is update on move, useful for tracking distance/direction/gestures.
* Added Game.state - now contains a reference to the current state object (if any was given).
* Moved the Input start events from the constructors to a single Input.start method.
* Added Input.disabled boolean to globally turn off all input event processing.
* Added Input.Mouse.disabled, Input.Touch.disabled, Input.MSPointer.disabled and Input.Keyboard.disabled.
* Added Device.mspointer boolean. true if MSPointer is available on the device.
* Added Input.onDown, onUp, onTap, onDoubleTap and onHold signals - all fired by the mouse or touch.

* Added GameObject.setBoundsFromWorld to quickly set the bounds of a game object to match those of the current game world.
* Added GameObject.canvas and GameObject.context. By default they reference Stage.canvas but can be changed to anything, i.e. a DynamicTexture
* The new canvas and context references are applied to Sprite, GeomSprite and TilemapLayer
* Added DynamicTexture.assignCanvasToGameObjects() to allow you to redirect GameObject rendering en-mass to a DynamicTexture
* Added DynamicTexture.render(x,y) to render the texture to the Stage canvas
* Added Basic.ignoreGlobalUpdate - stops the object being updated as part of the main game loop, you'll need to call update on it yourself
* Added Basic.ignoreGlobalRender - stops the object being rendered as part of the main game loop, you'll need to call render on it yourself
* Added forceUpdate and forceRender parameters to Group.update and Group.render respectively. Combined with ignoreGlobal you can create custom rendering set-ups
* Fixed Loader.progress calculation so it now accurately passes a value between 0 and 100 to your loader callback
* Added a 'hard reset' parameter to Input.reset. A hard reset clears Input signals (such as on a state swap), a soft (such as on game pause) doesn't
* Added Device.isConsoleOpen() to check if the browser console is open. Tested on Firefox with Firebug and Chrome with DevTools
* Added delay parameter to Tween.to()
* Fixed bug where GeomSprite.renderOutline was being ignored for Circle objects

* Updated Collision.seperate to use the new CollisionMask
* Added a callback context parameter to Game.collide, Collision.overlap and the QuadTree class
* Stage.canvas now calls preventDefault() when the context menu is activated (oncontextmenu)
* Added Point.rotate to allow you to rotate a point around another point, with optional distance clamping. Also created test cases.
* Added Group.alpha to apply a globalAlpha before the groups children are rendered. Useful to save on alpha calls.
* Added Group.globalCompositeOperation to apply a composite operation before all of the groups children are rendered.
* Added Camera black list support to Sprite and Group along with Camera.show, Camera.hide and Camera.isHidden methods to populate them. 
* Added GameMath.rotatePoint to allow for point rotation at any angle around a given anchor and distance
* Updated World.setSize() to optionally update the VerletManager dimensions as well
* Added GameObject.setPosition(x, y)

* Updated Sprite.inCamera to correctly apply the scrollFactor to the camera bounds check
* Added Loader.crossOrigin property which is applied to loaded Images
* Added AnimationManager.destroy() to clear out all local references and objects
* Added the clearAnimations parameter to Sprite.loadGraphic(). Allows you to change animation textures but retain the frame data.
* Added the GameObjectFactory to Game. You now make Sprites like this: game.add.sprite(). Much better separation of game object creation methods now. But you'll have to update ALL code, sorry! (blame JesseFreeman for breaking your code and coming up with the idea :)
* Added GameObjectFactory methods to add existing objects to the game world, such as existingSprite(), existingTween(), etc.
* Added the GameObjectFactory to Phaser.State
* Added new format parameter to Loader.addTextureAtlas defining the format. Currently supported: JSON Array and Starling/Sparrow XML.

Version 0.9.5

* Moved the BootScreen and PauseScreen out of Stage into their own classes (system/screens/BootScreen and PauseScreen).
* Updated the PauseScreen to show a subtle animation effect, making it easier to create your own interesting pause screens.
* Modified Game so it splits into 3 loops - bootLoop, pauseLoop and loop (the core loop).
* Updated the BootScreen with the new logo and new color cycle effect.
* Added Game.isRunning - set to true once the Game.boot process is over IF you gave some functions to the constructor or a state.
* Fixed small bug in Signal.removeAll where it could try to shorten the _bindings even if undefined.
* Added the new FXManager which is used for handling all special effects on Cameras (and soon other game objects).
* Removed Flash, Fade and Shake from the Camera class and moved to the new SpecialFX project.
* SpecialFX compiles to phaser-fx.js in the build folder, which is copied over to Tests. If you don't need the FX, don't include the .js file.
* The project is now generating TypeScript declaration files and all Tests were updated to use them in their references.
* Fixed a bug in Flash, Fade and Shake where the duration would fail on anything above 3 seconds.
* Fixed a bug in Camera Shake that made it go a bit haywire, now shakes correctly.
* Added new Scanlines Camera FX.
* Fixed offset values being ignored in GeomSprite.renderPoint (thanks bapuna).
* Added new Mirror Camera FX. Can mirror the camera image horizontally, vertically or both with an optional fill color overlay.
* Added Camera.disableClipping for when you don't care about things being drawn outside the edge (useful for some FX).
* Updated TilemapLayer so that collision data is now stored in _tempTileBlock to avoid constant array creation during game loop.
* TilemapLayer.getTileOverlaps() now returns all tiles the object overlapped with rather than just a boolean.
* Tilemap.collide now optionally takes callback and context parameters which are used if collision occurs.
* Added Tilemap.collisionCallback and Tilemap.collisionCallbackContext so you can set them once and not re-set them on every call to collide.
* Collision.separateTile now has 2 extra parameters: separateX and separateY. If true the object will be separated on overlap, otherwise just the overlap boolean result is returned.
* Added Tile.separateX and Tile.separateY (both true by default). Set to false if you don't want a tile to stop an object from moving, you just want it to return collision data to your callback.
* Added Tilemap.getTileByIndex(value) to access a specific type of tile, rather than by its map index.
* Added TilemapLayer.putTile(x,y,index) - allows you to insert new tile data into the map layer (create your own tile editor!).
* TilemapLayer.getTileBlock now returns a unique Array of map data, not just a reference to the temporary block array
* Added TilemapLayer.swapTile - scans the given region of the map for all instances of tileA and swaps them for tileB, and vice versa.
* Added TilemapLayer.replaceTile - scans the given region of the map and replaces all instances of tileA with tileB. tileB is left unaffected.
* Added TilemapLayer.fillTiles - fills the given region of the map with the tile specified.
* Added TilemapLayer.randomiseTiles - fills the given region of the map with a random tile from the list specified.
* Added fun new "map draw" test - rebound those carrots! :)
* Changed SoundManager class to respect volume on first play (thanks initials and hackmaniac)

Version 0.9.4

* Added Tilemap.getTile, getTileFromWorldXY, getTileFromInputXY
* Added Tilemap.setCollisionByIndex and setCollisionByRange
* Added GameObject.renderRotation boolean to control if the sprite will visually rotate or not (useful when angle needs to change but graphics don't)
* Added additional check to Camera.width/height so you cannot set them larger than the Stage size
* Added Collision.separateTile and Tilemap.collide
* Fixed Tilemap bounds check if map was smaller than game dimensions
* Fixed: Made World._cameras public, World.cameras and turned Game.camera into a getter for it (thanks Hackmaniac)
* Fixed: Circle.isEmpty properly checks diameter (thanks bapuna)
* Updated Gruntfile to export new version of phaser.js wrapped in a UMD block for require.js/commonJS (thanks Hackmaniac)

V0.9.3

* Added the new ScrollZone game object. Endlessly useful but especially for scrolling backdrops. Created 6 example tests.
* Added GameObject.hideFromCamera(cameraID) to stop an object rendering to specific cameras (also showToCamera and clearCameraList)
* Added GameObject.setBounds() to confine a game object to a specific area within the world (useful for stopping them going off the edges)
* Added GameObject.outOfBoundsAction, can be either OUT OF BOUNDS STOP which stops the object moving, or OUT OF BOUNDS KILL which kills it.
* Added GameObject.rotationOffset. Useful if your graphics need to rotate but weren't drawn facing zero degrees (to the right).
* Added shiftSinTable and shiftCosTable to the GameMath class to allow for quick iteration through the data tables.
* Added more robust frame checking into AnimationManager
* Re-built Tilemap handling from scratch to allow for proper layered maps (as exported from Tiled / Mappy)
* Tilemap no longer requires a buffer per Camera (in prep for WebGL support)
* Fixed issues with Group not adding reference to Game to newly created objects (thanks JesseFreeman)
* Fixed a potential race condition issue in Game.boot (thanks Hackmaniac)
* Fixed issue with showing frame zero of a texture atlas before the animation started playing (thanks JesseFreeman)
* Fixed a bug where Camera.visible = false would still render
* Removed the need for DynamicTextures to require a key property and updated test cases.
* You can now pass an array or a single value to Input.Keyboard.addKeyCapture().

Version 0.9.2

* Fixed issue with create not being called if there was an empty init method.
* Added ability to flip a sprite (Sprite.flipped = true) + a test case for it.
* Added ability to restart a sprite animation.
* Sprite animations don't restart if you call play on them when they are already running.
* Added Stage.disablePauseScreen. Set to true to stop your game pausing when the tab loses focus.

Version 0.9.1

* Added the new align property to GameObjects that controls placement when rendering.
* Added an align example to the Sprites test group (click the mouse to change alignment position)
* Added a new MicroPoint class. Same as Point but much smaller / less functions, updated GameObject to use it.
* Completely rebuilt the Rectangle class to use MicroPoints and store the values of the 9 points around the edges, to be used
for new collision system.
* Game.Input now has 2 signals you can subscribe to for down/up events, see the Sprite align example for use.
* Updated the States examples to bring in-line with 0.9 release.

Version 0.9

* Large refactoring. Everything now lives inside the Phaser module, so all code and all tests have been updated to reflect this. Makes coding a tiny bit more verbose but stops the framework from globbing up the global namespace. Also should make code-insight work in WebStorm and similar editors.
* Added the new GeomSprite object. This is a sprite that uses a geometry class for display (Circle, Rectangle, Point, Line). It's extremely flexible!
* Added Geometry intersection results objects.
* Added new Collision class and moved some functions there. Contains all the Game Object and Geometry Intersection methods.
* Can now create a sprite animation based on frame names rather than indexes. Useful when you've an animation inside a texture atlas. Added test to show.
* Added addKeyCapture(), removeKeyCapture() and clearCaptures() to Input.Keyboard. Calls event.preventDefault() on any keycode set to capture, allowing you to avoid page scrolling when using the cursor keys in a game for example.
* Added new Motion class which contains lots of handy functions like 'moveTowardsObject', 'velocityFromAngle' and more.
* Tween Manager added. You can now create tweens via Game.createTween (or for more control game.tweens). All the usual suspects are here: Bounce, * Elastic, Quintic, etc and it's hooked into the core game clock, so if your game pauses and resumes your tweens adjust accordingly.

Version 0.8

* Added ability to set Sprite frame by name (sprite.frameName), useful when you've loaded a Texture Atlas with filename values set rather than using frame indexes.
* Updated texture atlas 4 demo to show this.
* Fixed a bug that would cause a run-time error if you tried to create a sprite using an invalid texture key.
* Added in DynamicTexture support and a test case for it.

Version 0.7

* Renamed FullScreen to StageScaleMode as it's much more fitting. Tested across Android and iOS with the various scale modes.
* Added in world x/y coordinates to the input class, and the ability to get world x/y input coordinates from any Camera.
* Added the RandomDataGenerator for seeded random number generation.
* Setting the game world size now resizes the default camera (optional bool flag)

Version 0.6
