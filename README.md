# Phaser

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/jump.jpg" align="right">

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Cocoon, Cordova and Electron.

Along with the fantastic open source community Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm Limited](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support and a developer friendly API Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.

Thousands of developers worldwide use it. From indies and multi-national digital agencies to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible games. Grab the source and join in the fun!

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="using-phaser"></a>
## Using Phaser

Phaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development and the minified version for production.

### Custom Builds

Phaser includes a grunt based build system which allows you to strip out lots of additional features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then you can now exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be stripped out too.

As a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.

See the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.

<a name="browserify"></a>
### Browserify / CJS

Phaser was never written to be modular. Everything exists under one single global namespace, and you cannot `require` selected parts of it into your builds. It expects 3 global vars to exist in order to work properly: `Phaser`, `PIXI` and `p2`. The following is one way of doing this:

```
window.PIXI = require('phaser/build/custom/pixi')
window.p2 = require('phaser/build/custom/p2')
window.Phaser = require('phaser/build/custom/phaser-split')
```

If you build a custom version of Phaser (see above) it will split the 3 core libs out into their own files, allowing you to require them as above.

We appreciate this is just a band-aid and not a proper use of modules, but please understand it was never built to be used this way. You're trying to fit a square peg in a round browserify-shaped hole, so compromises have to be made. Please don't open GitHub issues about it. We've no intention of changing Phaser at this stage of its life. Full module based development is being undertaken in Lazer.

### Webpack

Starting from Phaser 2.4.5 we now include a custom build for Webpack.

You need to add `p2` as a dependency.

##### Webpack Config

```
var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');

var phaserModule = path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/phaser/');
var phaser = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/phaser-split.js'),
  pixi = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/pixi.js'),
  p2 = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/p2.js');

module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /pixi.js/, loader: "script" },
        ]
    },
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            'phaser': phaser,
            'pixi.js': pixi,
            'p2': p2,
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

##### Main js file

```
require('pixi.js');
require('p2');
require('phaser');
```

### Building from source

Should you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.

Run `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.

We add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

Phaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.

While Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with regard to memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.

### IE9

If you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x **and** use P2 physics then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Phaser is developed in JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't *force* you to. It's your choice.

If you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="road-map"></a>
## Road Map

The majority of Phaser development is now taking place on the [Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) (Phaser 3) project. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported and issues fixed, but roadmap features have been migrated over.

<a name="lazer"></a>
## Lazer

[Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) is the next generation of the Phaser game framework, and was previously called Phaser 3. Using a completely ES6 base it is renderer agnostic, allowing for DOM, SVG, Canvas and WebGL rendering, across desktop and mobile web browsers.

**Lazer is in active development but is not yet ready for production use.**

You can read all about the philosophy behind Lazer [here](http://phaser.io/news/2016/01/phaser-in-2015-and-beyond) or join the Google Group [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) where progress reports are posted. You can also follow progress in the Phaser World newsletter.

<a name="change-log"></a>
## Change Log

## Version 2.4.9 - "Four Kings" - In Development

### New Features

* Phaser.Line.intersectsRectangle checks for intersection between a Line and a Rectangle, or any Rectangle-like object such as a Sprite or Body.
* Group.getClosestTo will return the child closest to the given point (thanks @Nuuf #2504)
* Group.getFarthestFrom will return the child farthest away from the given point (thanks @Nuuf #2504)
* Animation.reverse will reverse the currently playing animation direction (thanks @gotenxds #2505)
* Animation.reverseOnce will reverse the animation direction for the current, or next animation only (thanks @gotenxds #2505)
* The way the display list updates and Camera movements are handled has been completely revamped, which should result is significantly smoother motion when the Camera is following tweened or physics controlled sprites. The `Stage.postUpdate` function is now vastly reduced in complexity. It takes control over updating the display list (calling `updateTransform` on itself), rather than letting the Canvas or WebGL renderers do this. Because of this change, the `Camera.updateTarget` function uses the Sprites `worldPosition` property instead, which is now frame accurate (thanks @whig @Upperfoot @Whoisnt @hexus #2482)
* Game Objects including Sprite, Image, Particle, TilemapLayer, Text, BitmapText and TileSprite have a new property called `data`. This is an empty Object that Phaser will never touch internally, but your own code, or Phaser Plugins, can store Game Object specific data within it. This allows you to associate data with a Game Object without having to pollute or change its class shape.
* TilemapLayers will now collide properly when they have a position that isn't set to 0x0. For example if you're stitching together several maps, one after the other, and manually adjust their `scrollX/Y` properties (thanks @Upperfoot #2522)
* There are a bunch of new Phaser consts available to help with setting the angle of a Game Object. They are `Phaser.ANGLE_UP`, `ANGLE_DOWN`, `ANGLE_LEFT`, `ANGLE_RIGHT`, `ANGLE_NORTH_EAST`, `ANGLE_NORTH_WEST`, `ANGLE_SOUTH_EAST` and `ANGLE_SOUTH_WEST`.
* Math.between will return a value between the given `min` and `max` values.

### Updates

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @wingyplus @monagames @marineorganism @obamor)
* Docs typo fixes (thanks @seanirby)
* The TypeScript defs ambient declaration has been updated to make it compatible with the SystemJS loader (thanks @monagames)
* You can no longer intersect check a Body against itself (thanks @VitaZheltyakov #2514)
* The mobile template has been updated (thanks @cryptographer #2518)
* Video.onComplete wouldn't fire on iOS if the user hit the 'Done' button before the video had finished playing. It now uses the `webkitendfullscreen` event to detect this, and dispatches the `onComplete` signal should that event fire (thanks @kelu-smiley #2498)
* Sound.addMarker now has a default value for the `duration` argument (1 second) to avoid the DOM Exception 11 error if you accidentally miss it out (thanks @mari8i #2508)
* Removed the `Stage.updateTransform` calls from the main game loop, because it happens automatically as part of `Game.updateLogic` anyway, so was duplicating the workload for no reason.
* TilemapLayer.postUpdate could potentially be called several times per frame (depending on device frame rate), which would cause multiple texture redraws, even though only the last texture is used during rendering. This has now been modified so that the local TilemapLayer canvas is only re-rendered once per frame, during the rendering phase, and not during the logic update phase.
* Stage has had all of its core update loops modified, so they now iterate through the display list forwards, instead of in reverse. Stage.postUpdate is now also a lot smaller, with no conditional branching if there is a Camera Target or not.
* Within RequestAnimationFrame both `updateRAF` and `updateSetTimeout` now only call `game.update` if `isRunning` is true. This should avoid asynchronous Game destroy errors under environments like Angular (thanks @flogvit #2521)
* Group.removeAll has a new argument `destroyTexture` which allows you to optionally destroy the BaseTexture of each child, as it is removed from the Group (thanks @stoneman1 #2487)
* PluginManager.remove has a new argument `destroy` (defaults to `true`) which will let you optionally called the `destroy` method of the Plugin being removed.
* Cache.getJSON used to incorrectly bring back a deep-copy of the Phaser.Utils object, instead of just a clone of the JSON object requested (thanks @drhayes #2524 #2526)

### Bug Fixes

* Arcade Physics Body incorrectly positioned if the Sprite had a negative scale (see http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/22695-247-248-body-anchoring-any-migration-tips/) (thanks @SBCGames @icameron @Nuuf @EvolViper #2488 #2490)
* InputHandler.checkPointerDown had an incorrect single pipe character |, instead of an OR check ||, and an `isDown` check, causing Button Over events to fail (thanks @pengchuan #2486)
* BitmapText objects with lines greater than `maxWidth` now handle alignment values correctly, causing them to properly center align (thanks @kevinleedrum  #2499 @crippledcactus #2496)
* Text has a new private method `measureLine` which is used to calculate the final Text line length, after factoring in color stops and other style changes. This should prevent characters from becoming truncated (thanks @TadejZupancic #2519 #2512)
* Sometimes the browser would cause a race condition where any connected Game Pads were being detected before the callback had a chance to be established. Also sometimes the rawPad references would become stale, and are now checked constantly (thanks @cwleonard #2471)

### Pixi Updates

Please note that Phaser uses a custom build of Pixi and always has done. The following changes have been made to our custom build, not to Pixi in general.
