# Phaser - HTML5 Game Framework

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/arcade-cab.png" align="right">

Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering, and supports desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native desktop apps via 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.

Along with the fantastic open source community, Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.

### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor

[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.

![Building Phaser](http://phaser.io/images/github/div-building-phaser.png "Building Phaser")
<a name="building-phaser"></a>

Phaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version for production. You can also create your own builds.

### Custom Builds

Phaser includes a grunt based build system, which allows you to strip out  features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be excluded too.

As a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.

See the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.

<a name="browserify"></a>
### Browserify / CJS

Phaser was never written to be modular. Everything exists under one single global namespace, and you cannot `require` selected parts of it into your builds. It expects 3 global vars to exist in order to work properly: `Phaser`, `PIXI` and `p2`. The following is one way of doing this:

```
window.PIXI = require('phaser/build/custom/pixi')
window.p2 = require('phaser/build/custom/p2')
window.Phaser = require('phaser/build/custom/phaser-split')
```

If you build a custom version of Phaser it will split the 3 core libs out into their own files, allowing you to require them as above.

We appreciate this is just a band-aid, and not a proper use of modules, but please understand it was never built to be used this way. You're trying to fit a square peg in a round browserify-shaped hole, so compromises have to be made. Please don't open GitHub issues about it as we've no intention of changing Phaser at this stage of its life. Full module based development is being undertaken in Lazer, the next iteration of the Phaser framework.

### Webpack

Starting from Phaser 2.4.5 we now include a custom build for Webpack.

You need to add `p2` as a dependency.

##### Webpack Config

```
var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');

var phaserModule = path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/phaser/');
var phaser = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/phaser-split.js'),
  pixi = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/pixi.js'),
  p2 = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/p2.js');

module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /pixi.js/, loader: "script" },
        ]
    },
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            'phaser': phaser,
            'pixi.js': pixi,
            'p2': p2,
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

##### Main js file

```
require('pixi.js');
require('p2');
require('phaser');
```

### Building from source

Should you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.

Run `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.

We add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!

![Requirements](http://phaser.io/images/github/div-requirements.png "Requirements")
<a name="requirements"></a>

Phaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.

While Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.

### IE9

If you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x _and_ use P2 physics, then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Phaser is developed in ES5 JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code, and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't _force_ you to. It's your choice.

If you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.

![Road Map](http://phaser.io/images/github/div-roadmap.png "Road Map")
<a name="road-map"></a>

The majority of Phaser development is now taking place within the [Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) project. Lazer is the name for Phaser version 3. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported, and issues fixed, but most roadmap features have been migrated over.

<a name="lazer"></a>
## Lazer

[Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) is the next generation of the Phaser game framework, and was previously called Phaser 3. Using a completely ES6 base it is renderer agnostic, allowing for DOM, SVG, Canvas and WebGL rendering, across desktop and mobile web browsers.

**Lazer is in active development, but is not yet ready for production use.**

You can read all about the philosophy behind Lazer [here](http://phaser.io/news/2016/01/phaser-in-2015-and-beyond) or join the Google Group [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) where progress reports are posted. You can also follow progress in the [Phaser World](#newsletter) newsletter.

![Change Log](http://phaser.io/images/github/div-change-log.png "Change Log")
<a name="change-log"></a>

## Version 2.6.2 - "Kore Springs" - In Development

### New Features

* Group.getRandomExists will return a random child from the Group that has exists set to true.
* Group.getAll will return all children in the Group, or a section of the Group, with the optional ability to test if the child has a property matching the given value or not.
* Group.iterate has a new `returnType`: `RETURN_ALL`. This allows you to return all children that pass the iteration test in an array.

### Updates

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks )
* Docs typo fixes (thanks @rroylance @Owumaro)
* The InputHandler.flagged property has been removed. It was never used internally, or exposed via the API, so was just overhead.
* The src/system folder has been removed and all files relocated to the src/utils folder. This doesn't change anything from an API point of view, but did change the grunt build scripts slightly.
* BitmapData.shadow and BitmapData.text now both `return this` keeping them in-line with the docs (thanks @greeny #2634)

### Bug Fixes

* A Group with `inputEnableChildren` set would re-start the Input Handler on a Sprite, even if that handler had been disabled previously.
*
*

### Pixi Updates

Please note that Phaser uses a custom build of Pixi and always has done. The following changes have been made to our custom build, not to Pixi in general.

*
*
*

For changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
