"Being negative is not how we make progress" - Larry Page, Google

Welcome to Phaser
-----------------

We're very pleased to have finally shipped the 1.0 release of Phaser. This version represents many months of hard work, feedback and refactoring based on the previous 0.5 through to 0.97 releases. You can see the full gory details in our change log.

Sorry but the jsdocs aren't yet finished, but it is now our priority (along with bug fixing). If you run into problems, or just want to chat about how to best use Phaser then please do join our forums. It's an active and inspiring community.

Now 1.0 is released we'll focus on getting the docs and more examples completed. Both of these will be pushed to the master repo on a regular basis. We will tag new releases of Phaser, but changes to the examples or docs won't be release tagged.

Thank you to everyone who has encouraged us along the way. To those of you who worked with Phaser during its various incarnations, and who released full games with it despite there being zero API documentation available: you are our heroes. It's your kind words and enthusiasm, as well as our commercial need for Phaser that has kept us going. Now we're at 1.0 we will continue releasing rapidly and jumping on patches and bug reports quickly.

Phaser is everything we ever wanted from an HTML5 game framework. It will power all our client work going forward and we look forward to you joining us on this journey.

Change Log
----------

Version 1.0.7 (in progress in the dev branch)

* JSDoc is go! We've added jsdoc3 blocks to every property and function, in every file.
* Added World.postUpdate - all sprite position changes, as a result of physics, happen here before the render.
* Complete overhaul of Physics.Arcade.Body - now significantly more stable and faster too.
* Updated ArcadePhysics.separateX/Y to use new body system - much better results now.
* QuadTree bug found in 1.0.5 now fixed. The QuadTree is updated properly now using worldTransform values.
* Fixed the Bounce.In and Bounce.InOut tweens (thanks XekeDeath)
* Renamed Phaser.Text.text to Phaser.Text.content to avoid conflict and overwrite from Pixi local var.
* Renamed Phaser.Text.style to Phaser.Text.font to avoid conflict and overwrite from Pixi local var.
* Phaser.Button now sets useHandCursor to true by default.
* Fixed an issue in Animation.update where if the game was paused it would get an insane delta timer throwing a uuid error.
* Added PixiPatch.js to patch in a few essential features until Pixi is updated.
* Fixed issue in Animation.play where the given frameRate and loop values wouldn't overwrite those set on construction.
* Added Animation.paused - can be set to true/false.
* New: Phaser.Animation.generateFrameNames - really useful when creating animation data from texture atlases using file names, not indexes.
* Added Sprite.play as a handy short-cut to play an animation already loaded onto a Sprite.
* Fixed small bug stopping Tween.pause / resume from resuming correctly when called directly.
* Fixed an issue where Tweens.removeAll wasn't clearing tweens in the addition queue.
* Change: When you swap State all active tweens are now purged.
* BUG: Loader conflict if 2 keys are the same even if they are in different packages (i.e. "title" for picture and audio).
* Fixed Particle Emitters when using Emitter width/height (thanks XekeDeath)
* Made animation looping more robust when skipping frames (thanks XekeDeath)
* Fix for incorrect new particle positioning (issue #73) (thanks cottonflop)
* Added support for Body.maxVelocity (thanks cocoademon)
* Fixed issue in Sound.play where if you gave a missing marker it would play the whole sound sprite instead.
* Button.setFrames will set the current frame based on the button state immediately.
* InputHandler now creates the _pointerData array on creation and populates with one empty set of values, so pointerOver etc all work before a start call.
* Added Canvas.setUserSelect() to disable touchCallouts and user selections within the canvas.
* When the game boots it will now by default disable user-select and touch action events on the game canvas.
* Loaded.setPreloadSprite now rounds the width/height values and starts from 1. This fixes canvas draw errors in IE9/10 and Firefox.
* Fixed issue causing Keyboard.justPressed to always fire (thanks stemkoski)
* Added Keyboard.addKey() which creates a new Phaser.Key object that can be polled for updates, pressed states, etc. See the 2 new examples showing use.
* Removed the callbackContext parameter from Group.callAll because it's no longer needed.
* Updated Group.forEach, forEachAlive and forEachDead so you can now pass as many parameters as you want, which will all be given to the callback after the child.
* Updated build script so it can be run from the command-line and includes UMD wrappers (thanks iaincarsberg)
* Fixed bug in LinkedList#remove that could cause first to point to a dead node (thanks onedayitwillmake)
* Moved LinkedList.dump to Debug.dumpLinkedList(list)


* TODO: addMarker hh:mm:ss:ms
* TODO: Direction constants
* TODO: Camera will adjust core DO. Means scrollFactor will need to be dropped sadly, but there are other ways to emulate its effect.

Version 1.0.6 (September 24th 2013)

* Added check into Pointer.move to always consider a Sprite that has pixelPerfect enabled, regardless of render ID.
* BUG: The pixel perfect click check doesn't work if the sprite is part of a texture atlas yet.
* Fixed issue with anti-alias in the Game constructor not being set correctly (thanks luizbills)
* Added support for the Graphics game object back in and two examples (thanks earok for spotting)
* New: Tweens can now be chained via multiple to() calls + example created (thanks to powerfear for adding)
* Fixed Math.wrap (thanks TheJare)
* New: When loading a Sprite Sheet you can now pass negative values for the frame sizes which specifies the number of rows/columns to load instead (thanks TheJare)
* New: BitmapText now supports anchor and has fixed box dimensions (thanks TheJare)
* Fixed bug where if a State contains an empty Preloader the Update will not be called (thanks TheJare)
* Several new examples added (cameras, tweens, etc)
* Added in extra checks to halt collision if it involves an empty Group (thanks cang)
* Added time smoothing to Animation update to help frames hopefully not get too out of sync during long animations with high frame rates.
* Added frame skip to Animation.update. If it gets too far behind it will now skip frames to try and catch up.

Version 1.0.5 (September 20th 2013)

* Fixed issue in FrameData.getFrameIndexes where the input array was being ignored.
* Added Math.numberArray - Returns an Array containing the numbers from min to max (inclusive), useful for animation frame construction.
* Fixed a horrendously sneaky bug: If a new tween was created in the onComplete callback of a tween about to be deleted, it would get automatically spliced.
* Added a pendingDelete property to Tween to stop tweens that were removed during a callback from causing update errors during the TweenManager loop.
* Added Group.length property.
* Added explicit x/y attributes to Phaser.Text to make it work with the camera system (thanks cocoademon).
* Fixed issue stopping multiple animations from playing, only the most recent would play (frames array was being overwritten, thanks Legrandk)
* Updated Debug.renderSpriteBounds() so it doesn't use the deprecated Sprite.worldView any more (thanks MikeMnD)
* Added 2 new properties to the Text object: Text.text and Text.style, both are getter/setters and don't flag dirty unless changed, so safe for core loop use.
* Removed the exists check from Group.callAll, it now runs on all children (as the name implies)
* Added Group.callAllExists - you can now call a function on all children who have exists = the provided boolean.
* Finished off the Breakout example game - now fully playable, proper rebound, scoring, lives, etc.
* Removed Group.sort dummy entry until it's working.
* Removed ArcadePhysics.postUpdate.
* Updated Sprite.update to set renderable to false when the object goes out of Camera, not 'visible' false, otherwise it stops the transform being updated by Pixi.
* BUG: There is a known issue where the wrong rect coordinates are given to the QuadTree if the Sprite is a child of a Group or another Sprite which has an x/y offset.

Version 1.0.4 (September 18th 2013)

* Small fix to Phaser.Canvas to stop it from setting overflow hidden if the parent DOM element doesn't exist.
* Added Loader.setPreloadSprite(sprite, direction) - this will automatically apply a crop rect to the Sprite which is updated in line with the load progress.
* A lot of changes inside the StateManager. State functions are now passed through link() which automatically creates the key Game properties (load, input, etc)
* Fixed a bug in getFrameByName that wouldn't return the first frame in the array.
* Updated Phaser.Rectangle.intersects to use x and y instead of left and top so it can be used to check Physics bodies overlapping.
* Fixed issue in Cache where the Frame index wasn't being set correctly (thanks Cameron)
* Fixed issue in Sprite where boundsY wasn't set (thanks Cameron)
* For some reason there were 2 copies of the Canvas class in the build file - fixed, a few KB saved :)

Version 1.0.3 (September 17th 2013)

* FrameData.getFrameIndexes and getFrameIndexesByName refactored into a more versatile getFrames function.
* Various fixes to looping parameters in the Sound system.
* Documentation started across most classes. Keep track of progress in the Docs folder.
* Optimised AnimationManager.add so it will only get the required frames rather than all of them and is now faster at parsing the frame data.
* Fixed Phaser.Text and Phaser.BitmapText so they now render correctly and added several Text examples.

Version 1.0.2 (September 16th 2013)

* Added optional parameter to Animation.stop: resetFrame. If true the animation will be stopped and then the current frame reset to the first frame in the animation.
* Fixed an issue causing 'explode' particle bursts to ignore the quantity parameter.
* Added 'collideWorldBounds' to Emitter.makeParticles function.
* Added Emitter.angularDrag
* Changed Emitter.bounce from a number to a Point, so now set its x/y properties to control different amounts of bounce per axis.
* Fixed a bug in the AnimationManager where useNumericIndex was always set to true
* Added in lots of Particle examples
* Added in the start of a Breakout game
* Added in the start of a Platformer game

Version 1.0.1 (September 15th 2013)

* Added checks into every Group function to ensure that the Group has children before running them.
* Added optional flag to Group.create which allows you to set the default exists state of the Sprites.
* Sprite.animation.stop no longer needs an animation name parameter, will default to stopping the current animation.
* Fixed the license in package.json
* Fixed a logic bug in the separateTileX function that would sometimes cause tunneling of big sprites through small tiles.

Requirements
------------

Games created with Phaser require a modern web browser that supports the canvas tag. This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. It also works on mobile web browsers including stock Android 2.x browser and above and iOS5 Mobile Safari and above.

For developing with Phaser you can use either a plain-vanilla JavaScript approach or [TypeScript](https://typescript.codeplex.com/). We made no assumptions about how you like to code your games, and were careful not to impose any form of class/inheritance/structure upon you.

Phaser is 275 KB minified and 62 KB gzipped.

Features
--------

**WebGL &amp; Canvas**

Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support. This allows for lightning fast rendering across Desktop and Mobile. Phaser uses and contributes towards the excellent Pixi.js library for rendering.

**Preloader**

We've made the loading of assets as simple as one line of code. Images, Sounds, Sprite Sheets, Tilemaps, JSON data, XML - all parsed and handled automatically, ready for use in game and stored in a global Cache for Sprites to share.

**Physics**

Phaser ships with our Arcade Physics system. An extremely light-weight AABB physics library perfect for low-powered devices and fast collision response. Control velocity, acceleration, bounce, drag and full collision and separation control.

**Sprites**

Sprites are the life-blood of your game. Position them, tween them, rotate them, scale them, animate them, collide them, paint them onto custom textures and so much more!
Sprites also have full Input support: click them, touch them, drag them around, snap them - even pixel perfect click detection if needed.

**Groups**

Group bundles of Sprites together for easy pooling and recycling, avoiding constant object creation. Groups can also be collided: for example a "Bullets" group checking for collision against the "Aliens" group, with a custom collision callback to handle the outcome.

**Animation**

Phaser supports classic Sprite Sheets with a fixed frame size, Texture Packer and Flash CS6/CC JSON files (both Hash and Array formats) and Starling XML files. All of these can be used to easily create animation for Sprites.

**Particles**

An Arcade Particle system is built-in, which allows you to create fun particle effects easily. Create explosions or constant streams for effects like rain or fire. Or attach the Emitter to a Sprite for a jet trail.

**Camera**

Phaser has a built-in Game World. Objects can be placed anywhere within the world and you've got access to a powerful Camera to look into that world. Pan around and follow Sprites with ease.

**Input**

Talk to a Phaser.Pointer and it doesn't matter if the input came from a touch-screen or mouse, it can even change mid-game without dropping a beat. Multi-touch, Mouse, Keyboard and lots of useful functions allow you to code custom gesture recognition.

**Sound**

Phaser supports both Web Audio and legacy HTML Audio. It automatically handles mobile device locking, easy Audio Sprite creation, looping, streaming and volume. We know how much of a pain dealing with audio on mobile is, so we did our best to resolve that!

**Tilemaps**

Phaser can load, render and collide with a tilemap with just a couple of lines of code. We support CSV and Tiled map data formats with multiple tile layers. There are lots of powerful tile manipulation functions: swap tiles, replace them, delete them, add them and update the map in realtime.

**Device Scaling**

Phaser has a built-in Scale Manager which allows you to scale your game to fit any size screen. Control aspect ratios, minimum and maximum scales and full-screen support.

**Plugin system**

We are trying hard to keep the core of Phaser limited to only essential classes, so we built a smart Plugin system to handle everything else. Create your own plugins easily and share them with the community.

**Mobile Browser**

Phaser was built specifically for Mobile web browsers. Of course it works blazingly fast on Desktop too, but unlike lots of frameworks mobile was our main focus. If it doesn't perform well on mobile then we don't add it into the Core.

**Developer Support**

We use Phaser every day on our many client projects. As a result it's constantly evolving and improving and we jump on bugs and pull requests quickly. This is a living, breathing framework maintained by a commercial company with custom feature development and support packages available. We live and breathe HTML5 games.

**Battle Tested**

Although Phaser 1.0 is a brand new release it is born from years of experience building some of the biggest HTML5 games out there. We're not saying it is 100% bug free, but we use it for our client work every day, so issues get resolved <em>fast</em> and we stay on-top of the changing browser landscape.

Known Issues
------------

* The TypeScript definition file isn't yet complete.
* The JSDOCS are not yet complete.

Future Plans
------------

The following list is not exhaustive and is subject to change:

* Integrate Advanced Physics system.
* Integrate Advanced Particle system.
* Better sound controls and audio effects.
* Google Play Game Services.
* Ability to layer another DOM object and have it controlled by the game.
* More GUI components: checkbox, radio button, window, etc.
* Tilemap: more advanced Tiled support and support for DAME tilemaps.
* Joypad support.
* Gestures input class.
* Flash CC html output support.
* Game parameters read from Google Docs.

Right now however our main focus is on documentation and examples, we won't be touching any of the above features until the docs are finished.

Test Suite
----------

Phaser comes with an ever growing Test Suite. Personally we learn better by looking at small refined code examples, so we create lots of them to test each new feature we add. Inside the Tests folder you'll find the current set. If you write a particularly good test then please send it to us.

The tests need running through a local web server (to avoid file access permission errors from your browser).

Make sure you can browse to the Tests folder via your web server. If you've got php installed then launch:

    examples/index.php

Right now the Test Suite requires PHP, but we will remove this requirement soon.

You can also browse the [Phaser Test Suite](http://gametest.mobi/phaser/) online.

Contributing
------------

Phaser is in early stages and although we've still got a lot to add to it, we wanted to get it out there and share it with the world.

If you find a bug (highly likely!) then please report it on github or our forum.

If you have a feature request, or have written a small game or demo that shows Phaser in use, then please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you.

You can do this on the Phaser board that is part of the [HTML5 Game Devs forum](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/14-phaser/) or email: rich@photonstorm.com

Bugs?
