# Phaser

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/jump.jpg" align="right">

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS and Android apps via 3rd party tools.

Along with the fantastic open source community Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm Limited](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support and a developer friendly API Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on Github.

Thousands of developers worldwide use it. From indies and multi-national digital agencies to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible games. Grab the source and join in the fun!

## What's new in Phaser 2.4.5

<div align="center"><img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/news.jpg"></div>

> 15th October 2015

The release of Phaser 2.4.4 continues our work with bug fixes, new features and optimizations. As with the previous version it's a point-release, making it a safe upgrade for anyone using an earlier 2.4 build.

Internally here at Phaser HQ we have been busy with several new projects. 

First we released [Interphase](http://phaser.io/interphase/), a new 400-page publication for Phaser developers. Packed full of exclusive content including 8 complete games, tutorials and a deep dive into the Phaser State Manager. It's been a blast to write and we have been really encouraged by the response from readers. We're planning on releasing Interphase 2 before the end of the year.

We've also released [Particle Storm](http://phaser.io/shop/plugins/particlestorm). An advanced particle system allowing you to easily create stunning special effects in your games with just a few lines of code. Our primary design goal was to create a particle system that was extremely flexible. It was important that you should be able to easily integrate the effects into your games. Particles are constructed through easy-to-understand JavaScript objects with multiple properties and options to let you quickly put together complex visuals with minimum effort.

As we close in towards the end of 2015 there are still a couple of new releases on the horizon, as well as Phaser 2.4.5. We're also getting very close to a fully working build of Phaser 2 using our new renderer. As always, keep you eyes on the Phaser web site or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) for the latest news.

Finally we'd be extremely grateful if you could get involved with our [Phaser Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). The uptake so far has been fantastic. Thank you to everyone who now supports Phaser development and shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming and Phasers role in that.

Happy coding everyone! See you on the forums.

Cheers,

Rich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/learn.jpg" align="right">

We have a [Getting Started Guide](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) which covers all you need to begin developing games with Phaser. From setting up a web server, to picking an IDE and coding your first game.

Prefer **videos** to reading? Lynda.com have published a video based course: [HTML5 Game Development with Phaser](http://www.lynda.com/Phaser-tutorials/HTML5-Game-Development-Phaser/163641-2.html) (requires subscription)

The single biggest Phaser resource is the new [Phaser web site](http://phaser.io/news). It has hundreds of tutorials listed and fresh ones are added every week, so keep coming back to see what's new!

Using Phaser with **TypeScript**? Check out this great series of [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx) tutorials.

### Source Code Examples

Ever since we started Phaser we've been growing and expanding our extensive set of source code examples. Currently there are over 700 of them!

Browse the [Phaser Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) or clone the [examples repo][examples] and eat your heart out!

### Interphase

<div align="center"><img src="http://phaser.io/content/interphase/1/images/editorial/pages.jpg"></div>

[Interphase](http://phaser.io/interphase) is a new book for Phaser developers of all skill levels.

With 400 pages of content you'll find detailed articles, game development "Making Of" guides and tutorials. All were written using the latest version of Phaser, so you won't be learning any out-dated tricks here.

As well as the book you get all the source code, graphics and assets to go with it, as well as lots of extras too.

[Read More](http://phaser.io/interphase)

### Game Mechanic Explorer

The [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com) is a great interactive way to learn how to develop specific game mechanics in Phaser. Well worth exploring once you've got your dev environment set-up.

### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor

[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="using-phaser"></a>
## Using Phaser

Phaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development and the minified version for production.

### Custom Builds

Starting from Phaser 2.3.0 we now include a brand new build system which allows you to strip out lots of additional features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then you can now exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be stripped out too.

As a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.

See the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.

### Building from source

Should you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.

Run `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.

We add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!

![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

Phaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.

While Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with regard to memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.

### IE9

If you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x **and** use P2 physics then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Phaser is developed in JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't *force* you to. It's your choice.

If you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.

<a name="road-map"></a>
## Road Map

The majority of Phaser development is now taking place on the Phaser 3 project. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported and issues fixed, but roadmap features have been migrated over to Phaser 3.

<a name="phaser3"></a>
## Phaser 3

We're now a good way in to development of Phaser 3. We've been working hard on creating a brand new and extremely powerful renderer. Progress reports are posted to the [web site](http://phaser.io/labs) and [Phaser 3 repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3).

There is still plenty of time to add your suggestions and feedback in [this forum thread](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread/).

If you are an exceptional JavaScript developer and would like to join the Phaser 3 development team then let us know. We have a limited budget available to pay towards your time.

## Phaser Nano

[Phaser Nano](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-nano) is a cut-down and optimized build of Phaser designed specifically for super low file-size environments such as banner ads and interstitials. It still uses the same friendly API as Phaser but in a much smaller footprint. The current release being just 8.3KB.

<a name="change-log"></a>
## Change Log

## Version 2.4.5 - "Sienda" - in dev

### New Features

* You can use the new const `Phaser.PENDING_ATLAS` as the texture key for any sprite. Doing this then sets the key to be the `frame` argument (the frame is set to zero). This allows you to create sprites using `load.image` during development, and then change them to use a Texture Atlas later in development by simply searching your code for 'PENDING_ATLAS' and swapping it to be the key of the atlas data.
* BitmapText.cleanText is a new method that will scan the given text and either remove or replace all characters that are not present in the font data. It is called automatically by `BitmapText.updateText`.
* ArcadePhysics.Body.onCeiling is a new complementary method to go with onFloor (thanks @yigitozdemir #1610)

### Updates

* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @zimpy @iamfreee @milkey-mouse @juanmirod @danzel @staff0rd)
* Docs typo fixes (thanks @zeterain @staff0rd @milkey-mouse @dick-clark @nlotz @s4wny @jonjanisch @Alaxe @cdelstad @tsphillips)
* Emitter methods `at`, `explode`, `flow`, `kill`, `revive`, `setAlpha`, `setRotation`, `setScale`, `setSize`, `setXSpeed`, `setYSpeed` and `start` now return the Emitter instance for better method chaining (thanks @samme #2308)
* Tilemap.hasTile will now return `false` if the Tile doesn't exist in the coordinates given (which can happen if the coordinates are out of bounds) (thanks @cy-ryo-fujiwara #2304)
* Update FrameData to check if both the numeric index was set and exists. Should fix Phaser Tiled integration as a result (thanks @Weedshaker #2298)
* Loader.loadUpdate now gets one final call when the loading is complete (before it would end and then call loadComplete, but if you had a callback bound to loadUpdate you'd never get that final 100% load event). (thanks @nexiuhm @McFarts #2297 #2296)
* The TypeScript definitions now have Phaser exported as a module in the header. This allows you to import / require the Phaser TypeScript defs (thanks @PixelWaffles #2255)
* BitmapData.setHSL now accepts 0 as a valid parameter (thanks @FracturedShader #2209)
* Force the usage of typescript 1.4.1 in the package.json so that the TypeScript defs with comments is rebuilt properly again (thanks @vulvulune #2198)
* A tiny logic update in the StateManager (thanks @jaminscript #2151)
* The Style object passed in to Phaser.Text is now cloned instead of referenced. This means you can adjust single Text instances without invaliding other Text objects using the same style object (thanks @asyncanup #2267)
* Added a typescript section to the bower and npm configs to support `tsd link` (thanks @mjohnsonengr #2189 #2180)
* SoundManager.destroy now calls AudioContext.close (thanks @stoneman1 #2237)
* Sound.onEndedHandler now sets Sound.currentTime to be Sound.durationMS (thanks @stoneman1 #2237)

### Bug Fixes

* Buttons (or any Sprites) that don't have a texture, but have children, would incorrectly render the children under WebGL due to the baseTexture.skipRender property (thanks @puzzud #2141)
* TilemapParser accidentally redeclared `i` when parsing the ImageCollections which would cause an infinite loop (thanks DanHett)
* BitmapData.update causes a snowballing memory leak under WebGL due to a Context.getImageData call. BitmapData.clear used to call update automatically but no longer does. This resolves the issue of the Debug class causing excessive memory build-up in Chrome. Firefox and IE were unaffected (thanks @kingjerod #2208)
* Pausing a Sound that used a Marker for playback would fire the `onMarkerComplete` signal by mistake as well as stop the fadeTween. This Signal is now only dispatched if Sound.stop is called and the Sound isn't paused (thanks Corin)
* BitmapText.text would throw an undefined Texture error if you used a character in your text string that didn't exist in the font data.
* Animation.stop will now stop the named animation only if the `name` argument is passed and matches the currently running animation (thanks @samme #2299 #2301)
* TilemapParser accidentally redeclared `i` when parsing Tilemap Layers (thanks @ttencate and @aweber1  #2244 #2233 #2281)
* Added `removeAll` to TweenManagers stub, so the call from the StageManager doesn't throw an error in a custom build (thanks @RetrocadeNet #2284)
* Loader.binary would return a success even if the xhr'd file returned a 404 or similar (thanks @milkey-mouse @mhstar89 #2251 #2250)
* When loading audio or video from blob or data URIs, the local variable was replaced too soon, throwing errors in `getAudioURL` and `getVideoURL` (thanks @milkey-mouse @jackfreak #2236 #2234)
* Tween.hasStarted parameter was set to `false` when the tween was created, but not set again when the tween was stopped or ends. If `Tween.start` is used more than once the `onStart` callback is called only the first time (thanks @javivi91 #2199)
* During a WebGL context loss the Phaser Cache was referencing the wrong local object (thanks @allenevans #2285)
* The Video game object used an anonymous bound function for both the 'ended' and 'playing' event listeners, meaning that they were never removed properly (thanks @ramalhovfc #2303)
* BitmapData.shiftHSL incorrectly used Math.limitValue, now updated to use Math.clamp (thanks @FracturedShader #2222)
* The Loader was deleting the next waiting file from the queue if an asset pack was added after the load had started (thanks @tfelix #2203 #2204)
* Specifying Phaser.ScaleManager.EXACT_FIT as the scaleMode in a game config object would fail to use the scale mode (thanks @06wj #2248)

### Pixi Updates

Please note that Phaser uses a custom build of Pixi and always has done. The following changes have been made to our custom build, not to Pixi in general.


For changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
